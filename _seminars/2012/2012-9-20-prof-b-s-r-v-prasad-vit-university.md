Necessity to understand the role of additional food as a tool
in biological control programs is being increasingly felt, particularly
due to its Eco-friendly nature. In this present talk, we develop/analyse a
variation of standard predator-prey model with Holling type II function
response which presents predator-prey dynamics in presence of some
additional food to predators.  The aim is to study the consequences of
providing additional food on the system dynamics. A thorough mathematical
analysis reveals that handling times for the available foods play a vital
role in determining the eventual state of the system.  It is interesting
to observe that by varying the quality (characterised by the handling times)
and quantity of additional food we can not only control and limit the
prey, but also limit and eradicate the predators. In the context of
biological pest control, the results caution the manager on the choice of
quality and quantity of the additional food used for this purpose.  We
further study the controllability aspects of the predator-prey system by
considering quality of the additional food as the control variable.
Control strategies are offered to steer the system from a given initial
state to a required terminal state in a minimum time by formulating Mayer
problem of optimal control. It is observed that an optimal strategy is a
combination of
bang-bang controls and could involve multiple switches. Properties of
optimal paths are derived using necessary conditions for Mayer problem. In
the light of the results evolved in this work it is possible to eradicate
the prey from the system in the minimum time by providing the predator
with high quality additional food, which is relevant in the pest
management. In the perspective of biological conservation this study
highlights the possibilities to drive the state to an admissible interior
equilibrium (irrespective of its stability nature) of the system in a
minimum time.
