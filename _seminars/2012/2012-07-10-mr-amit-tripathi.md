In this thesis we study some Questions on vector bundles over hypersurfaces. More precisely, for hypersurfaces of dimension $\\\\geq 2$, we study the extension problem of Vector bundles. We try to find some conditions under which a vector bundle over an ample divisor of non-singular projective variety, extends as a vector bundle to an open set containing that ample divisor.
