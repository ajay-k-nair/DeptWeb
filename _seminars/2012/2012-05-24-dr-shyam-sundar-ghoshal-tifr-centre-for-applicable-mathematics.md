We prove the Structure Theorem of the entropy solution. Furthermore we obtain the shock regions each of which represents a single shock at infinity. Using the structure Theorem we construct initial data $u_0\\\\in C_c^\\\\f$ for which the solution exhibits infinitely many shocks as $t \\\\rightarrow \\\\f$. Also we have generalized the asymptotic behavior (the work of Dafermos, Liu, Kim) of the solution and obtain the rate of decay of the solution with respect to the $N$-wave.
