Ricci flow is a PDE that deform the metric of a Riemannian manifold in the
direction of its Ricci curvature. For compact smooth manifolds, there is a
well established existence and uniqueness theory. However for some
applications it can be useful to consider Ricci flows of
non-smooth spaces, or metric spaces whose distance doesn't come from a
Riemannian metric. We will show that existence and uniqueness holds for
the Ricci flow of compact singular surfaces whose curvature is bounded
from below in the sense of Alexandrov.
