Google has recently released open source software called `course-builder' (at https://code.google.com/p/course-builder/) to make interactive online courses consisting of videos interleaved with quizzes. In this brief presentation, I will show as an example a course-builder course I made and describe the process of making such courses. My goal is to convince that making online courses is both easy and worthwhile.
