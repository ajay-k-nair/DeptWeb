The $4$-genus of a knot is an important measure of complexity, related to
the unknotting number. A fundamental result used to study the $4$-genus
and related invariants of homology classes is the \\emph{Thom Conjecture},
proved by Kronheimer-Mrowka, and its symplectic extension due to
Ozsvath-Szabo, which say that \\textit{closed} symplectic surfaces
minimize genus.
