ChatGPT and other advances in Artificial Intelligence have become popular sensations. In parallel with this has been an enormous advance in the digitization of mathematics through Interactive Theorem Provers and their libraries. Artificial Intelligence has started entering mathematics through these and other routes.

This session will have some presentations/demos about present use of Computer Proofs, Artificial Intelligence together and separately in Mathematics and related fields (including software), both in research and in teaching. After that everyone is welcome to discuss their work, ideas, wish-lists etc related to these themes.
