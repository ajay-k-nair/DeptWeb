 Hitchin's theory of Higgs bundles associated holomorphic differentials on a Riemann surface to representations of the fundamental group of 
 the surface into a Lie group. We study the geometry common to representations whose associated holomorphic differentials lie on a ray. 
 In the setting of SL(3,R), we provide a formula for the asymptotic holonomy of the representations in terms of the local geometry of the differential. 
 Alternatively, we show how the associated equivariant harmonic maps to a symmetric space converge to a harmonic map to a building, with geometry 
 determined by the differential. All of this is joint work with John Loftin and Mike Wolf.
