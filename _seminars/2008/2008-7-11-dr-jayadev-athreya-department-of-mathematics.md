We apply some of the ideas of the Ph.D. Thesis of G. A. Margulis to
Teichmuller space. Let x be a point in Teichmuller space, and let
B_R(x) be the ball of radius R centered at x (with distances measured
in the Teichmuller metric). We obtain asymptotic formulas as R tends
to infinity for the volume of B_R(x), and also for for the
cardinality of the intersection of B_R(x) with an orbit of the
mapping class group.
