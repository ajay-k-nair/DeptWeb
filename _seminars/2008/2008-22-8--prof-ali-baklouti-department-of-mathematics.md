The aim of this series of lectures is to seek analogies of some known
uncertainty principles, proved in the case of the real line to certain
solvable Lie groups. We will speak about uncertainty principles of Hardy,
Cowling  Price, Morgan and Beurling and present some recent results on
their non  commutative analogues. Furthermore, we will also talk about
sharpness of the decay condition in Hardys principle and give some new
result in that context.
