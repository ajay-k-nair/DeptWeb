The central question will be focused around the design and implementation
of neuronal circuitry involved in the task of decoding sensory
information. Sensory information is encoded in the form of sequence of
action potential spikes by the peripheral nervous system. This information
is then passed onto the central nervous system (CNS) to generate an
appropriate response. The action potential spikes are identical in shape
and therefore it is assumed that all the information about the environment
is embedded in the timing of occurrences of these spikes. The question
then is, what neural architecture exists in the CNS to decode this
information?
