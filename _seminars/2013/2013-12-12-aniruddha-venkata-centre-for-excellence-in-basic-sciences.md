A family of sets is said to be union-closed if the union of any
two sets from the family remains in the family. Frankl's conjecture, aka
the union-closed sets conjecture, is the remarkable statement that for any
finite union-closed family of finite sets, there exists an element that
belongs to at least half of the sets in the family. Originally stated in
1979, it is still wide open.

This will be an informal discussion on progress towards the conjecture.
