HOTT (homotopy type theory) is logic built on type theory
(mostly from Computer Science) and ideas from topology to give
foundations of mathematics that are very elegant and much closer
to mathematical practice. This makes HOTT very useful for computer
proof systems, and also gives a very nice new synthetic treatment
of homotopy theory.
