We will introduce the notion of a differential graded algebra
that is not strictly associative, but associative up to chain
homotopy. Such objects are called A-infinity algebras or strong
homotopy associative algebras.  The goal is to state and prove
the Homotopy Transfer Theorem, which states that any chain
complex that is chain homotopic to an A-infinity algebra has
an A-infinity structure and the maps in the chain homotopy
can be lifted to a map of A-infinity algebras.
