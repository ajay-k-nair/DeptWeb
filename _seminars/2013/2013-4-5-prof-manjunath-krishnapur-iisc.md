In the seqries of 4 lectures, we will cover some aspects of the
Littlewood-Offord problem. This problem concerns the anti-concentration
phenomenon of sums of independent random variables and has applications to
invertibility of random matrices and statistics of real zeros of random
polynomials. The subject overlaps probability, combinatorics, additive
combinatorics and some algebra.
