title: "Renormalization and reverse renormalization in the dynamics of germs of holomorphic diffeomorphisms in C."
time: "11-12 am."

We discuss the renormalization and reverse renormalization constructions used in studying the dynamics of germs of holomorphic diffeomorphisms fixing the origin in C with linear part a rotation. Such a germ is said to be linearizable if it is analytically conjugate to its linear part.
