The systole of a compact Riemannian manifold (M,g) is the length of
the shortest non contractible loop of M, it is attained by a periodic
geodesic. A systolic inequality is a lower on the volume of any
Riemannian metric depending only on the systole. If one consider the
systole as a kind of 'belt size' of (M,g), a systolic inequality just
says 'the bigger the belt, the bigger the guy'. In this talk, we will
discuss systolic inequalities for surfaces. We will prove optimal
results for the torus and the projective plane (which go back to
Loewner and Pu in the 50's) and non optimal results for higher genus
surfaces (due to Hebda and Gromov in the 80's). This topic involve a
nice mixture of metric geometry and elementary topology. If time
permits, we will say a few words about higher dimensions.
