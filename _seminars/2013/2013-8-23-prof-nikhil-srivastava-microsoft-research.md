The Kadison-Singer problem is a question in operator theory which arose in
1959 while trying to make Dirac's axioms for quantum mechanics
mathematically rigorous. Over the course of several decades, this question
was reduced to several equivalent conjectures about finite matrices, and
shown to have significant implications in applied mathematics, computer
science, and various branches of pure mathematics.
