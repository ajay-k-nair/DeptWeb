One of the main goals of classical metric Diophantine
approximation is to quantify the denseness of the rational numbers in the
real numbers, or more generally, of Q^d in R^d. An equally natural problem
is to quantify the denseness of the rational points on the sphere, and more
generally, rational points in other compact and non-compact algebraic
sub-varieties in R^d. We will describe a solution to this problem for a large
class of homogeneous varieties.
