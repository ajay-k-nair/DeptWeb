In this thesis we investigate single and multi-player stochastic dynamic optimization problems in both discrete and continuous time. In the multi-player setup we investigate zero-sum games with both complete and partial information. We study partially observable stochastic games with average cost criterion and the state process being discrete time controlled Markov chain. We establish the existence of the value of the game and also obtain optimal strategies for both players. We also study a continuous time zero-sum stochastic game with complete observation. In this case the state is a pure jump Markov process. We investigate the finite horizon total cost criterion. We characterise the value function via appropriate Isaacs equations. This also yields optimal Markov strategies for both players.
