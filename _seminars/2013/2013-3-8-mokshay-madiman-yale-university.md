Tools from additive combinatorics are finding their way into
numerous areas of mathematics and applied mathematics, and in
particular have been central to recent developments in both random
matrix theory and harmonic analysis. The goal of this short course is
to understand some of these tools. (If time permits and the audience
is willing to pitch in with some talks, we may also cover selected
applications.)
