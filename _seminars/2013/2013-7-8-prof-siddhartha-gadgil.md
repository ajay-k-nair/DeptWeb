Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT), developed recently in a large
collaboration centered at IAS, Princeton, combines elements
from type theory, logic and topology to give alternative foundations
of mathematics which are much closer to mathematical practice (useful
for Automated Reasoning). HoTT also gives new insights into topology.
