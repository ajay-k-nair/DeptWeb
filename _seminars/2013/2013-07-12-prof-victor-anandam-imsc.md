The classical (as well as axiomatic) potential theory has been developed in the context of the study of analytic functions on Riemann surfaces, Newton potentials and Markov processes. This talk aims to develop a discrete version of potential theory on infinite graphs, based on the examples of electrical networks and infinite graphs.
