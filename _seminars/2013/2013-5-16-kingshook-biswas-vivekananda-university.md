title: "Moebius and conformal maps between boundaries of CAT(-1) spaces."
time: "11-12 AM."

Motivated by rigidity problems for negatively curved manifolds,
we study Moebius and conformal maps $f : \\partial X \\to \\partial Y$
between boundaries of CAT(-1) spaces $X, Y$ equipped with visual metrics.
