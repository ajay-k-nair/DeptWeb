The Lectures will focus on topics that go beyond the classical framework of Hilbert spaces of holomorphic functions (Bergman spaces, Hardy spaces) on the unit ball or more general bounded symmetric domains. The main point is to include vector-valued functions and even cohomology classes for non-convex domains. The plan of the lectures is as follows:
