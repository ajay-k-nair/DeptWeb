In this lecture I will survey - aimed at a broad mathematical audience -
the development of linear and integer programming. The history of these
subjects began about one and a half centuries ago but their "boom" started
in the 1950s only. Theory, algorithm design and analysis dominated the
first years of development. Computational progress was   particularly
significant in the last twenty years. In fact, the advances in linear and
integer programming software are on at least the
same level as those in computing machinery.

These achievements combined with successful efforts to model applications
make it possible to solve today real world problems of breath taking size
and diversity. I will report about some of these success stories in my
talk.
