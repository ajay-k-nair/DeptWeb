It is well known that there exist domains in C^n, n > 1, such that all functions holomorphic therein extend holomorphically past the boundary. In this talk, we shall examine this surprising phenomenon by discussing refinements of the fundamental example of Hartogs. We shall look at a generalization of Hartogs' construction discovered by Chirka. Finally, we shall provide a partial answer to a related question raised by Chirka.
