I will report on  the existence and properties of  Hilbert spaces
based on different families of complex, holomorphic or not,
functions, like Hermite polynomials. The resulting coherent state
quantizations of the complex plane will be presented. Some
interesting issues will be examined, like the  existence of the
usual harmonic oscillator spectrum despite the absence of canonical
commutation rules.
