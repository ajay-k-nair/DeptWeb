Classical geometric notion of the Yang-Mills functional has been generalized to the noncommutative context by A. Connes. In this talk we will see a suitable formulation of "subadditivity" and "additivity" of this action functional under a natural hypothesis on spectral triples, and show that in general the Yang-Mills functional is always subadditive. An instance of additivity will be discussed for the case of noncommutative torus.
