 In this talk I will give a brief introduction to Liouville
first-passage percolation (LFPP) which is a model for random metric on a
finite planar grid graph. It was studied primarily as a way to
understand the random metric associated with Liouville quantum gravity
(LQG), one of the major open problems in contemporary probability
theory. In short the Liouville quantum gravity is a (conjectured) one
parameter family of ``canonical'' random metrics on a Riemann surface. I
will discuss some recent results on this metric and the main focus will
be on estimates of the typical distance between two points. I will
highlight the apparent disagreement of these estimates with a prediction
made in the physics literature about the LQG metric. I will also mention
some (of many) future problems in this program. Based on a joint work
with Jian Ding.
