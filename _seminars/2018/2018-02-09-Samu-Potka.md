Edelman and Greene constructed a bijective correspondence between the
reduced words of the reverse permutation (n, n - 1, ..., 2, 1) and
standard Young tableaux of the staircase shape (n - 1, ..., 1).
Recently, motivated by random sorting networks, we studied this
bijection and discovered some new properties in joint work with Svante
Linusson. In this talk, I will discuss them and, if time permits, also a
related project with Linusson and Robin Sulzgruber on random sorting
networks where the intermediate permutations avoid the pattern 132.
