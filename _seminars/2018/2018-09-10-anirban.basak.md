Consider a finitely banded Toeplitz matrix T_N and let E_N be an error matrix
with a polynomially vanishing operator norm. In this talk, we will discuss the
limiting spectral measure of T_N+E_N. We will see that under a very mild
assumption on the entries of E_N the limit is a push forward of the uniform
measure on the unit circle by the symbol of the Toeplitz matrix T_N. This is
based on an ongoing joint work with Elliot Paquette and Ofer Zeitouni.
