The classification of homogeneous scalar weighted shifts is known. Recently, 
Koranyi obtained a large class of inequivalent irreducible homogeneous 
bi-lateral 2-by-2 block shifts. We construct two distinct classes of examples 
not in the list of Koranyi. It is then shown that these new examples of 
irreducible homogeneous bi-lateral 2-by-2  block shifts, together with the ones found earlier by Koranyi, account for every
unitarily inequivalent irreducible homogeneous bi-lateral 2-by-2 block shift.
