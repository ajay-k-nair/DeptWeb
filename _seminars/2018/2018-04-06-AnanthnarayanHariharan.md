 We begin with a introduction to the notion of a resolution of a
module over a Noetherian ring, leading to Betti numbers over local or
graded rings, and some problems related to them. Most of the talk will
focus on the graded case.
  One of the recent developments in this area is the resolution of the
Boij-Soderberg conjectures by Eisenbud-Schreyer (2009). We discuss the
motivation behind the conjectures, with a quick word on the techniques
used in their resolution.
  If time permits, we will see other scenarios where parts of the
Boij-Soderberg conjectures hold, and discuss obstacles in extending the
Eisenbud-Schreyer techniques in general. This last part is joint work
with Rajiv Kumar.
