We will consider the following question:

Given a system of a fixed number of linearly independent homogeneous 
polynomial equations of a fixed degree with coefficients in a finite field F, 
what is the maximum number of common solutions they can have in the 
corresponding projective space over F? 

The case of a single homogeneous polynomial (i.e., hypersurface) corresponds 
to a classical inequality proved by Serre in 1989. For the general case, an elaborate 
conjecture was made by Tsfasman and Boguslavsky, which was open for almost two 
decades. We will outline these developments and report on some recent progress. 

An attempt will be made to keep the prerequisites at a minimum. If there is time and 
interest, connections to coding theory or to the problem of counting points of sections 
of Veronese varieties by linear subvarieties of a fixed dimension will also be outlined.
