Let X1 , X2 , X3, ... Xn be iid random variables. Laws of large numbers roughly state that the average of these variables converges to the expectation value of each of them when n is large. Various forms of these laws have many applications. The strong and weak laws along with the following three applications will be discussed:
a) Coin-tossing. 
b) The Weierstrass approximation theorem.
c) The Glivenko--Cantelli theorem. 

In the second half of this talk, a law of large numbers is proven for spaces with infinite "volume" (measure) as opposed to the above version for probability measures ("volume" =1).
