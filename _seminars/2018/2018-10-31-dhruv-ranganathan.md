Tropical geometry studies combinatorial structures
that arise as "shadows" or "skeletons" of algebraic
varieties. These skeletons were motivated in part
by the mirror symmetry conjectures in mathematical
string theory, but have now grown to function
broadly as a tool for the study of algebraic
varieties. Much of the work in the subject in the
past decade has focused on the geometry of moduli
spaces of abstract and parameterized algebraic
curves, their tropical analogues, and the
relationship between the two. This has led to new
results on the topology of $M_{g,n}$, the geometry
of spaces of elliptic curves, and to classical
questions about the geometry of Hurwitz spaces.
I will give an introduction to these ideas and
recent advances.
