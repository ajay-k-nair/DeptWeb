Elliptic curves are important objects of study in various areas of research in modern mathematics. In this talk I will develop some algebraic and geometric tools to understand the group structures on elliptic curves and their Isogenies (certain kind of homomorphisms). I will specialise the general study of Elliptic Curves over finite fields, define zeta functions of associated Elliptic Curve and state the Weil Conjectures.
