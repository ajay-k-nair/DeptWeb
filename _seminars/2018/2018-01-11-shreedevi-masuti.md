Gorenstein rings are very common and significant in many areas of mathematics. 
The following are two important and widely open problems in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry:
1. characterization of possible Hilbert functions of Gorenstein K-algebras; and
2. classification of Gorenstein K-algebras with given Hilbert functions.

Recently, in a joint work with M. E. Rossi, we obtained partial results to these problems in some cases
(K-algebras of socle degree 4). In this talk, we will discuss these new developments.
