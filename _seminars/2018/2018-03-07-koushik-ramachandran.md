Let $\\Omega\\subset\\mathbb{R}^d$
be a unbounded domain. A positive harmonic function u in $\\Omega$ that vanishes on the boundary $\\partial\\Omega$ is called a Martin function on $\\Omega$. In this talk, we will discuss various analytic and geometric aspects of Martin functions, namely how fast they grow at infinity, maximum on a slice, and convexity properties of their level lines. If time permits, we will also present a inverse balayage problem from Potential theory.
