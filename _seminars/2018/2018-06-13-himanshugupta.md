We consider a finite version of the one-dimensional Toom model with closed boundaries. Each site is occupied either by a particle of type 0 or of type 1, where the total number of particles of type 0 and type 1are fixed to be n_0 and n_1 respectively. We call this an (n_0,n_1)-system. The dynamics are as follows: the leftmost particle in a block can exchange its position with the leftmost particle of the block to its right.

In this thesis, we have shown the following. Firstly, we have proven a
conjecture
about the density of 1's in a system with arbitrary number of 0's and
1's. Secondly,
we have made progress on a conjecture for the nonequilibrium partition
function. In
particular, we have given an alternate proof of the conjecture for the
(1, n_1)-system
and (n_0, 1)-system, using an enriched two-dimensional model.
