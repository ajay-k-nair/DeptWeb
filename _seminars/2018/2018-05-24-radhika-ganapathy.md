Kazhdan's theory loosely states that the complex representation theory
of the group G($F$), where G is a split connected reductive group over
$\\mathbb{Z}$ and $F$ is a non-archimedean local field of characterstic $p$,
can be viewed as a "limit" of the complex representation theories of the
groups G($F'$), where $F'$ varies over non-archimedean local fields of
characteristic 0 with residue characteristic $p$. A similar theory for
representations of the Galois group Gal($F_s/F$) is due to Deligne. In
this talk we will review this theory, discuss some applications of this
theory to the local Langlands correspondence, and some ingredients in
generalizing the work of Kazhdan and some variants of it to non-split
groups.
