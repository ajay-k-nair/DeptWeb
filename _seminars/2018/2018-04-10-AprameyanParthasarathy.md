In these talks, we'll outline a simple proof of the Helgason conjecture for Riemannian symmetric spaces of rank one, which gives a correspondence between the eigenfunctions of moderate growth of the Laplacian on the symmetric space with distributions on the distinguished boundary. We'll then see how to use this to compare quantum resonances and scattering poles on these symmetric spaces. We also intend to indicate progress made towards a new proof of the Helgason conjecture in symmetric spaces of higher rank.
