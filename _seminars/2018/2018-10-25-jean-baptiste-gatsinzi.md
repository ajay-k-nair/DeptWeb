Formality is a topological property, defined in terms of Sullivan's model for a space. In the simply-connected setting, a space is formal if its rational homotopy type is determined by the rational cohomology ring.



In 1975, Deligne, Griffiths, Morgan and Sullivan proved that any compact Kaehler manifold is  formal. We study  the analogue for some contact manifolds. Such  spaces are obtained  as  the total space of some circle and sphere bundles over symplectic manifolds. These  include some Sasakian manifolds.
