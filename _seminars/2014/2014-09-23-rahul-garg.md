I shall begin with the mapping properties of classical Riesz potentials acting on $L^p$-spaces.
After reviewing the literature, I shall present our new "almost" Lipschitz continuity estimates
for these and related potentials (including, for instance, the logarithmic potential) in the
so-called supercritical exponent. Finally, I shall show how one could apply these estimates to
deduce Sobolev embedding theorems. This is joint work with Daniel Spector and is available on
arXiv:1404.1563.
