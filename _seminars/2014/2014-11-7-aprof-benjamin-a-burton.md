In this talk we explore new approaches to the old and difficult
computational problem of unknot recognition.  Although the best known
algorithms for this problem run in exponential time, there is increasing
evidence that a polynomial time solution might be possible.  We outline
several promising approaches, in which computational geometry, linear
programming and greedy algorithms all play starring roles.
