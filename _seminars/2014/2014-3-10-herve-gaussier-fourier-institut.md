We discuss the Gromov hyperbolicity of the Kobayashi metric on smooth
convex domains in Euclidean space. We prove that if the boundary contains
a holomorphic disc then the domain is not hyperbolic. On the other hand we
give examples of convex (but not strongly pseudoconvex) domains which are
hyperbolic. This is a joint work with Harish Seshadri.
