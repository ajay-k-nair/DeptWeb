Unlike the partial differential equations, the solutions of variational
inequalities exhibit singularities even when the data is smooth due to the
existence of free boundaries. Therefore the numerical procedure of these
problems based on uniform refinement becomes inefficient due to the loss
of the order of convergence. A popular remedy to enhance the efficiency of
the numerical method is to use adaptive finite element methods based on
computable a posteriori error bounds. Discontinuous Galerkin methods play
a very important role in the local mesh adaptive refinement techniques.
