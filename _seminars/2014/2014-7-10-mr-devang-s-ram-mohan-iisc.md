In this presentation we briefly recall some results on harmonic maps. Subsequently, we introduce the concept of minimal surfaces. After exploring a few examples, we mathematically formulate Plateau's problem regarding the existence of a soap film spanning each closed, simple wire frame and discuss a solution. In conclusion, certain partial results regarding the uniqueness of such a soap film are discussed.
