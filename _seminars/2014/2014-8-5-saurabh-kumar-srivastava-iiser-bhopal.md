In this talk we shall briefly discuss the theory of one-sided maximal functions. One-sided maximal function is a variant of the classical Hardy-Littlewood maximal function. The theory of one-sided maximal functions is an active research area. Specially, in the past two decades there has been a lot of research activities in this area.
