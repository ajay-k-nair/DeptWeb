In this talk we explore new approaches to the old and difficult
computational problem of unknot recognition.  Although the best known
algorithms for this problem run in exponential time, there is increasing
evidence that a polynomial time solution might be possible.  We outline
several promising approaches, in which computational geometry, linear
programming and greedy algorithms all play starring roles.

We finish with a new algorithm that combines techniques from topology and
combinatorial optimisation, which is the first to exhibit "real world"
polynomial time behaviour: although it is still exponential time in
theory, exhaustive experimentation shows that this algorithm can solve
unknot recognition for "practical" inputs by running just a linear number
of linear programs.
