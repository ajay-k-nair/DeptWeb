The dominant problem in applied mathematics is the application
of linear operators and solving linear equations. Dense linear systems
arise in numerous applications: Boundary integral equations for elliptic
partial differential equations, covariance matrices in statistics,
Bayesian inversion, Kalman filtering, inverse problems, radial basis
function interpolation, density functional theory, multi-frontal
solvers for sparse linear systems, etc. As the problem size increases,
large memory requirements scaling as $O(N^2)$ and extensive
computational time to perform matrix algebra scaling as $O(N^2)$ or
$O(N^3)$ make computations impractical, where $N$ is the underlying
number of degrees of freedom. This talk will discuss new fast algorithms
that scale as $O(N)$ for a class of problems, given a prescribed
tolerance. Applications in the context of Gaussian processes, Integral
equations for electromagnetic scattering, Symmetric factorization for Brownian 
dynamics, Bayesian inversion, Kalman filtering, multi-frontal solvers will also 
be presented.
