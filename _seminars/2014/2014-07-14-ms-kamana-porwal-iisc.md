Unlike the partial differential equations, the solutions of variational
inequalities exhibit singularities even when the data is smooth due to the
existence of free boundaries. Therefore the numerical procedure of these
problems based on uniform refinement becomes inefficient due to the loss
of the order of convergence. A popular remedy to enhance the efficiency of
the numerical method is to use adaptive finite element methods based on
computable a posteriori error bounds. Discontinuous Galerkin methods play
a very important role in the local mesh adaptive refinement techniques.

The main focus in this thesis has been on the derivation of reliable and
efficient error bounds for the discontinuous Galerkin methods applied to
elliptic variational inequalities. The variational inequalities can be
split into two kinds, namely, inequalities of the first kind and the
second kind. We study an elliptic obstacle problem and a Signorini contact
problem in the category of the first kind, while the frictional plate
contact problem in the category of the fourth order variational
inequalities of second kind. The mathematical analysis of error estimation
in this class of problems crucially depends on a suitable nonlinear
smoothing function that enriches the smoothness of the numerical solution.
Another remarkable advantage of discontinuous Galerkin methods has been
realized in the applications to higher order problems. Numerical
experiments support the theoretical results and exhibit optimal
convergence.
