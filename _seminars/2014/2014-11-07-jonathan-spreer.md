simpcomp is an official extension to the computer algebra system
GAP, that is, simpcomp is part of every full GAP installation. The
software allows the user to compute numerous properties of abstract
simplicial complexes such as the f -, g- and h-vectors, the fundamental
group, the automorphism group, (co-)homology, the intersection form, and
many more. It provides functions to generate simplicial complexes from
facet lists, orbit representatives, or permutation groups. In addition,
functions related to slicings and polyhedral Morse theory as well as a
combinatorial version of algebraic blowups and the possibility to resolve
isolated singularities of 4-manifolds are implemented.

In this talk, I will give an overview over the existing features of the
software and also discuss some ongoing projects such as (i) support for
Forman's discrete Morse theory for homology and fundamental group
computations, and (ii) an extension of the features to analyse tightness
of triangulated manifolds.
