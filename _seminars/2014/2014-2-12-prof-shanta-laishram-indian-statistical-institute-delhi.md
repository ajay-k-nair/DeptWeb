It is known that there are only finitely many perfect powers in non
degenerate binary recurrence sequences. However explicitly finding them is
an interesting and a difficult problem for binary recurrence sequences. A
recent breakthrough result of Bugeaud, Mignotte and Siksek states that
Fibonacci sequences (F_n) given by F_0 = 0; F_1 = 1 and
F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n
for n >= 0 are perfect powers only for F_0 = 0; F_1 = 1; F_2 = 1; F_6 = 8
and F_12 = 144.
