Given a L1 function f over an infinite measure space S how does one
estimate the integral of f using statistical tools? In this talk we
propose using regenerative sequences with heavy tails to do this. We
obtain a consistent estimator and show the rate of
convergence is slower than $1/\sqrt{n}$. When S is countable the SSRW
works.
