Non linear difference equations of order more than one is a relatively new and dynamic area of research in applied mathematics. In particular, the theory of Rational difference equations emerged in the last two decades and is an ongoing challenging field of study. In this talk we will present a brief introduction to nonlinear difference equations with some applications to various fields. Some techniques used in the qualitative analysis of the global character of solutions will be outlined. We will also discuss the results of a recent paper in which the speaker has addressed and generalized, an open problem posed by E. Camouzis and G. Ladas.
