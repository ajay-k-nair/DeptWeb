The goal of these talks is to discuss the history, the
circumstances, and (the main aspects of) the proof of
a recent result of ours, which says: a proper holomorphic
map between two nonplanar bounded symmetric domains of
the same dimension, one of them being irreducible, is
a biholomorphism.

Results of this character are motivated by a remarkable
theorem of H. Alexander about proper holomorphic
self-maps of the Euclidean ball. The first part of the
talk will focus on the meanings of the terms in the
above theorem. We will give an elementary proof that
the automorphism group of a bounded symmetric domain
acts transitively on it. But the existence of an
involutive symmetry at each point is restrictive in
many other ways. For instance, it yields a complete
classification of the bounded symmetric domains. This
follows from the work of Elie Cartan.

Earlier results in the literature that are special
cases of our result focused on different classes of
domains in the Cartan classification, and have mutually
irreconcilable proofs. One aspect of our work is a
unified proof: a set of techniques that works across
the Cartan classification. One of those techniques is
the use of an algebraic gadget: the machinery of Jordan
triple systems.

We will present definitions and examples related to
this machinery in the first part of the talk. In the
second part of the talk, we shall state a result on
finite-dimensional Jordan triple systems that is
essential to our work. After this, we shall discuss
our proof in greater depth.
