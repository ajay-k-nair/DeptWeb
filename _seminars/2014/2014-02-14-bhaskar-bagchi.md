Wolfgang Kuhnel introduced the notion of tightness and conjectured that
all tight triangulations of closed manifolds are strongly minimal. In a
recent paper with B. Datta (European J. Comb. 36 (2014), 294--313), the
speaker obtained a very general combinatorial criterion for tightness and
found results in partial confirmation of this conjecture. We shall discuss
these results.
