The talk is based on a joint paper with T.Alberts and J.Quastel.
We consider directed polymers in a random environment.
However the inverse temperature is scaled  with the length of
a polymer. It turn out that with a proper critical scaling one can get a
nontrivial universal behaviour for the partition function and the
end point distribution. Moreover the limiting partition function
distribution asymptotically converges to the Tracy-Widom law as the
rescaled inverse temperature tends to infinity.
