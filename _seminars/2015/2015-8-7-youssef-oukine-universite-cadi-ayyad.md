In the first part of this paper we give a solution for the
one-dimensional reflected backward
stochastic differential equation (BSDE for short) when the noise is driven
by a Brownian motion
and an independent Poisson random measure. The reflecting process is right
continuous with left
limits (RCLL for short) whose jumps are arbitrary. We first prove
existence and uniqueness of the
solution for a specific coefficient in using a method based on a
combination of penalization and the
Snell envelope theory. To show the general result we use a fixed point
argument in an appropriate
space. The second part of the paper is related to BSDEs with two
reflecting barriers. Once more we
prove existence and uniqueness of the solution of the BSDE.
