This talk is about random matrix theory.  Linear Algebra and
maybe a little probability are the only prerequisites.  Random matrix
theory is now finding many applications.  Many more applications remain to
be found. It is truly "matrix statistics," when traditional statistics has
been primarily "scalar" and "vector" statistics.  The math is so much
richer, and the applications to computational finance, HIV research, the
Riemann Zeta Function, and crystal growth, to name a few, show how
important this area is.  I will show some of these applications, and
invite you to find some of your own.
