One of the basic questions in harmonic analysis is to study the
decay properties of the Fourier transform of measures or
distributions supported on thin sets in $\\R^n$. When the support
is a smooth enough manifold, an almost complete picture is
available. One of the early results in this direction is the
following: Let $f\\in C_c^{\\infty}(d\\sigma)$, where
$d\\sigma$ is the surface measure on the sphere
$S^{n-1}\\subset\\R^n$. Then
