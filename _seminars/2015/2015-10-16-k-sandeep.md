It is well known that finding an explicit solution for partial
differential equations is almost impossible in most of the cases. In this
talk we will give a brief introduction to the analysis of certain
nonlinear PDEs using various tools from analysis. We will discuss some
concrete examples and some open problems (depending on time).
The talk should be accessible to senior undergraduate students.
