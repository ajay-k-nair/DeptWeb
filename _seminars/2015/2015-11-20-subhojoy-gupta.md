This talk shall be an introduction to some aspects of
Teichmüller theory, which is concerned with the parameter space of marked
Riemann surfaces. I shall describe Wolf's parametrization of Teichmüller
space using harmonic maps, and discuss how it extends to the Thurston
compactification. If time permits, I will describe some recent joint work
with Wolf.
