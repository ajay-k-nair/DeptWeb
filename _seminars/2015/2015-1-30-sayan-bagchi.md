In this talk we deal with two problems in harmonic analysis.
In the first problem we discuss weighted norm inequalities for Weyl
multipliers satisfying Mauceri's condition. As an application, we prove
certain multiplier theorems on the Heisenberg group and also show in the
context of a theorem of Weis on operator valued Fourier multipliers that
the R-boundedness of the derivative of the multiplier is not necessary
for the boundedness of the multiplier transform.
In the second problem we deal with a variation of a theorem of Mauceri
concerning the L^p boundedness of operators M which are known to be
bounded on L^2: We obtain sufficient conditions on the kernel of the
operator M so that it satisfies weighted L^p estimates. As an application
we prove L^p boundedness of Hermite pseudo-multipliers.
