I will report on work in progress with Radhika Ganapathy. One wishes to
study irreducible `smooth' complex representations of symplectic and
(split) orthogonal groups over local function fields, i.e., fields of the
form F_q((t)). The theory of `close local fields' proposes to do this by
studying the representation theory of these groups over (varying) finite
extensions of Q_p. We will discuss an approach to using this philosophy to
study the local Langlands correspondence for these groups.
