There is a dichotomy of contact structures-- tight vs
overtwisted. Classification of overtwisted contact structures up to
isotopy, due to Eliashberg, is well understood. However, there have been
few results towards classification of tight contact structures. In
general, given a contact structure it is difficult to know whether it is
tight or not.
