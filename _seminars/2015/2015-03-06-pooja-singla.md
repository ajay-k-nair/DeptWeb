Consider the problem of n cards labelled 1 through n, lying face
up on a table. Suppose two integers a and b are chosen independently and
uniformly between 1 and n. The cards labelled a and b are switched. If
many such transpositions are made the row of cards will tend to appear in
random arrangement. Then question is how many steps are required until the
deck is well mixed up (i.e. the permutation is close to random)? Diaconis
and Shahshahani used tools of representation theory of symmetric groups to
prove that at least 1/2(n log n) steps are required before the deck will
be well mixed up for large n. I will explain ideas of their proof and few
related problems.
