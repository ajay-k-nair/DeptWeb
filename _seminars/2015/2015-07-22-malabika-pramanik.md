A problem of interest in geometric measure theory both in discrete and continuous settings is
the identification of algebraic and geometric patterns in thin sets. The first two lectures will
be a survey of the literature on pattern recognition in sparse sets, with a greater emphasis on
continuum problems. The second two contain an exposition of recent work, joint in part with
Vincent Chan, Kevin Henriot and Izabella Laba on the existence of linear and polynomial configurations
in multi-dimensional Lebesgue-null sets satisfying appropriate Hausdorff and Fourier dimensionality
conditions.
