We consider integral lattices $L$ in an Euclidean space $V = \\mathbb{R}^m$, 
i.e. $\\mathbb{Z}$-submodules of full rank in $V$ such that all vectors in $L$ have 
integral length. It is impossible to classify such lattices up to 
isometry, there are just too many of them in general, even if we ﬁx 
additional invariants such as the discriminant. Therefore one looks for 
interesting subclasses of lattices, in particular "extremal lattices",
characterized by the property that the smallest length of a non-zero 
vector in $L$ is "as large as possible". There are several ways to
make this more precise, we will focus on analytic extremality, where modular forms
come in. In particular, we will consider extremality for maximal lattices.
