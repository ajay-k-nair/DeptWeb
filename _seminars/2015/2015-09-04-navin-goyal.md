Independent component analysis (ICA) is a basic problem that 
arises in several areas including signal processing, statistics, and 
machine learning. In this problem, we are given linear superpositions of 
signals. E.g., we could be receiving signals from several sensors but the 
receivers only get the weighted sums of these signals. The problem is to 
recover the original signals from the superposed data. In some situations 
this turns out to be possible: the main assumption being that the signals 
at different sensors are independent random variables. While independent 
component analysis is a well-studied problem, one version of it was not 
well-understood, namely when the original signals are allowed to be 
heavy-tailed, such as those with a Pareto distribution. Such signals do 
arise in some applications. In this talk, I will first discuss the 
previously known algorithms for ICA and then a new algorithm that applies 
also to for the heavy-tailed case. The techniques used are basic linear 
algebra and probability.
