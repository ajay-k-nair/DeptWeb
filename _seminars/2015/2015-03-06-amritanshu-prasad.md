A Kronecker coefficient counts the number of times a
representation of a symmetric group occurs in the tensor product of two
others. Finding a fast algorithm to determine when a Kronecker coefficient
is positive is an open problem. There has been an increased interest in
this problem over the last few years as it comes up in the geometric
approach to the complexity conjecture P = NP due to Mulmuley and Sohoni. I
will explain how a higher dimensional analogue of the
Robinson–Schensted–Knuth correspondence relates Kronecker coefficients to
the problem of counting the number of integer arrays with specified slice
sums.
