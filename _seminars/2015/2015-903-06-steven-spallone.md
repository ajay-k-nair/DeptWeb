Weyl discovered a decomposition of the invariant probability
measure on a connected compact Lie group, according to elements of a
maximal torus and their conjugacy classes. In the case of the unitary
group, it allowed Diaconis and Shahshahani to access the distribution of
the eigenvalues of a random unitary matrix. We explore these ideas in the
lecture.
