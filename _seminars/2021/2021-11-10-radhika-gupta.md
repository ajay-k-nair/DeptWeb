 A finitely generated group can be viewed as the group of symmetries of a metric space, for example its Cayley graph. When the metric space has non-positive 
 curvature, then the group satisfies some exceptional properties. In this talk, I will introduce two notions of non-positive curvature â€“ CAT(0) and delta 
 hyperbolic. I will present some results comparing groups acting on such spaces. I will also talk about the group of outer automorphisms of a free group, 
 which itself is neither CAT(0) nor delta-hyperbolic, but still benefits a lot from the presence of non-positive curvature.
