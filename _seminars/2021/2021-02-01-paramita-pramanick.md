For a commuting $d$-tuple of operators $\boldsymbol T=(T_1, \ldots , T_d)$ defined
on a complex separable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, let
$\big \[\big \[ \boldsymbol T^\*, \boldsymbol T \big \] \big \]$ be the $d \times d$
block operator $\big (\big ( \big \[ T_j^\*,T_i\] \big )\big )$ of commutators:
$\[T_j^\*,t_i\] := T_j^\* T_i - T_i T_j^\*$. We define an operator on the Hilbert space
$\mathcal{H}$, to be designated the determinant operator, corresponding to the block
operator $\big \[\big \[ \boldsymbol T^\*, \boldsymbol T \big \] \big \]$.
We show that if the $d$-tuple is cyclic, the determinant operator is positive and the
compression of a fixed set of words in $T_j^\*$ and $T_i$ -- to a nested sequence of
finite dimensional subspaces increasing to $\mathcal{H}$ -- does not grow very rapidly,
then the trace of the determinant of the operator $\big (\big ( \big \[ T_j^\*,T_i\] \big )\big )$
is finite. Moreover, an upper bound for this trace is given. This upper bound is shown
to be sharp for certain small class of commuting $d$-tuples. We make a conjecture of
what might be a sharp bound in much greater generality and verify it in many examples.

Let $\Omega$ be an irreducible classical bounded symmetric domain of rank $r$ in
$\mathbb{C}^d$. Let $\mathbb{K}$ be the maximal compact subgroup of the identity component
$G$ of the biholomorphic automorphism group of the domain $\Omega$. The group $\mathbb{K}$
consisting of linear transformations acts naturally on any $d$-tuple $\mathbf{T}$ of commuting
bounded linear operators by the rule:
\begin{equation}
k \cdot \mathbf{T} = \big( k_1(T_1, \dots, T_d), \dots, k_d(T_1, \dots, T_d) \big), \ k \in \mathbb{K},
\end{equation}
where $k_1(\mathbf{z}), \dots, k_d(\mathbf{z})$ are linear polynomials. If the orbit of this
action modulo unitary equivalence is a singleton, then we say that $\mathbf{T}$ is
$\mathbb{K}$-homogeneous. We realize a certain class of $\mathbb{K}$-homogeneous $d$-tuples
$\mathbf{T}$ as a $d$-tuple of multiplication by the coordinate functions $z_1, \dots, z_d$ on a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_K$. (The Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_k$ consisting of
holomorphic functions defined on $\Omega$, with $K$ as reproducing kernel.) Using this model we obtain
a criterion for (i) boundedness, (ii) membership in the Cowen-Douglas class, (iii) unitary
equivalence and similarity of these $d$-tuples. In particular, we show that the adjoint of the
$d$-tuple of multiplication by the coordinate functions on the weighted Bergman spaces are in
the Cowen-Douglas class $B_1(\Omega)$. For an irreducible bounded symmetric domain $\Omega$ of rank 2,
an explicit description of the operator $\sum_{i=1}^d T_i^\* T_i$ is given. Based on this formula, a
conjecture giving the form of this operator in any rank $r \geq 1$ was made. This conjecture was
recently verified by H. Upmeier.
