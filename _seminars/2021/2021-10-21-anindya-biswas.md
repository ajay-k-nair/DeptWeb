This work is concerned with the geometric and operator theoretic aspects of the bidisc
and the symmetrized bidisc. First, we have focused on the geometry of these two domains.
The symmetrized bidisc, a non-homogeneous domain, is partitioned into a collection of
orbits under the action of its automorphism group. We investigate the properties of
these orbits and pick out some necessary properties so that the symmetrized bidisc can
be characterized up to biholomorphic equivalence. As a consequence, among other things,
we have given a new defining condition of the symmetrized bidisc and we have found that
a biholomorphic copy of the symmetrized bidisc defined by E. Cartan. This work on the
symmetrized bidisc also helps us to develop a characterization of the bidisc. Being a
homogeneous domain, the bidisc's automorphism group does not reveal much about its
geometry. Using the ideas from the work on the symmetrized bidisc, we have identified
a subgroup of the automorphism group of the bidisc and observed the corresponding orbits
under the action of this subgroup. We have identified some properties of these orbits
which are sufficient to characterize the bidisc up to biholomorphic equivalence.

Turning to operator theoretic work on the domains, we have focused mainly on the Schur
Agler class class on the bidisc and the symmetrized bidisc. Each element of the Schur
Agler class on these domains has a nice representation in terms of a unitary operator,
called the realization formula. We have generalized the ideas developed in the context
of the bidisc and the symmetrized bidisc and applied it to the Nevanlinna problem and
the interpolating sequences. It turns out, our generalization works for a number of
domains, such as annulus and multiply connected domains, not only the bidisc and the
symmetrized bidisc.
