In 1998 Shuzhou Wang, in his pioneering work, introduced quantum symmetry groups of
finite spaces motivated by a general question posed by Alain Connes: _what is the
quantum automorphism group of a space?_ By finite spaces, here we mean
finite-dimensional C*-algebras. Wang's results have initiated several fundamental
developments in operator algebras, quantum groups and noncommutative geometry. Let
us consider a generalised situation where we shall equip the finite spaces with a
continuous action of the circle group. This talk aims to understand the object that
captures the quantum symmetries of these systems and their applications.
