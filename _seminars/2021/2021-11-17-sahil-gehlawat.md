In this talk, we will see an interplay between hermitian metrics and singular Riemann surface foliations.
It will be divided into ​three parts. The first part of the talk is about the study of curvature properties
of complete Kahler metrics on non-pseudoconvex domains. Examples of such metrics were constructed by Grauert
in 1956, who showed that it is possible to construct complete Kahler metrics on the complement of complex
analytic sets in a domain of holomorphy. In particular, he gave an explicit example of a complete Kahler
metric (the Grauert metric) on $\mathbb{C}^n \setminus \{0\}$. We will confine ourselves to the study of
such complete Kahler metrics. We will make some observations about the holomorphic sectional curvature of
such metrics in two prototype cases, namely (i) $\mathbb{C}^n \setminus \{0\}$, $n>1$, and (ii) $(B^N)\setminus A$,
where $A$ is an affine subspace. We will also study complete Kahler metrics using Grauert’s construction on
the complement of a principal divisor in a domain of holomorphy and show that there is an intrinsic continuity
in the construction of this metric, i.e., we can choose this metric in a continuous fashion if the corresponding
principal divisors vary continuously in an appropriate topology.

The second part of the talk deals with Verjovsky's _modulus of uniformization_ that arises in the study of the
leaf-wise Poincare metric on a hyperbolic singular Riemann surface lamination. This is a function defined away
from the singular locus. One viewpoint is to think of this as a domain functional. Adopting this view, we will
show that it varies continuously when the domains vary continuously in the Hausdorff sense. We will also give
an analogue of the classical Domain Bloch constant by D. Minda for hyperbolic singular Riemann surface laminations.

In the last part of the talk, we will discuss a parametrized version of the Mattei-Moussu theorem, namely a
holomorphic family of holomorphic foliations in $\mathbb{C}^2$ with an isolated singular point at the origin in
the Siegel domain are holomorphically equivalent if and only if the holonomy maps of the horizontal separatrix of
the corresponding foliations are holomorphically conjugate.
