We prove Hardy's inequalities for the fractional power of Grushin operator
$\mathcal{G}$ which is chased via two different approaches. In the first approach,
we first prove Hardy's inequality for the generalized sublaplacian. We first find
Cowling--Haagerup type of formula for the fractional sublaplacian and then using
the modified heat kernel, we find integral representations of the fractional
generalized sublaplacian. Then we derive Hardy's inequality for generalized
sublaplacian. Finally using the spherical harmonics, applying Hardy's inequality
for individual components, we derive Hardy's inequality for Grushin operator.
In the second approach, we start with an extension problem for Grushin, with
initial condition $f\in L^p(\mathbb{R}^{n+1})$. We derive a solution
$u(\cdot,\rho)$ to that extension problem and show that solution goes to $f$ in
$L^p(\mathbb{R}^{n+1})$ as the extension variable $\rho$ goes to $0$. Further
$-\rho^{1-2s}\partial_\rho u $ goes to $B_s\mathcal{G}_s f$ in $L^p(\mathbb{R}^{n+1})$
as $\rho$ goes to $0$, thereby giving us an another way of defining fractional
powers of Grushin operator. We also derive trace Hardy inequality for the Grushin
operator with the help of extension problem. Finally we prove $L^p$-$L^q$
inequality for fractional Grushin operator, thereby deriving Hardy--Littlewood--Sobolev
inequality for the Grushin operator.


Second theme consists of Hermite multipliers on modulation spaces $M^{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^n)$.
We find a relation between the boundedness of sublaplacian multipliers
$m(\tilde{\mathcal{L}})$ on polarised Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n_{pol}$ and the
boundedness of Hermite multipliers $m(\mathcal{H})$ on modulation spaces
$M^{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, thereby deriving the conditions on the multipliers $m$ to be
Hermite multipliers on modulation spaces. We believe those conditions on multipliers
are more than required restrictive. We improve the results for the special case $p=q$
of the modulation spaces $M^{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ by finding a relation between the
boundedness of Hermite multipliers on $M^{p,p}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and the boundedness of
Fourier multipliers on torus $\mathbb{T}^n$. We also derive the conditions for
boundedness of the solution of wave equation related to Hermite and the solution of
Schr\"odinger equation related to Hermite on modulation spaces.
