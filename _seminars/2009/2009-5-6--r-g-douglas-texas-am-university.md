About thirty-five years ago, several problems in operator theory
concerning almost normal operators led L. G. Brown, P. A. fillmore and me
to introduce methods and point of view from algebraic topology to solve
them.  By the time we were done concrete realization of K-homology was
introduced as well as new insight obtained for the index theorem of
Atiyah-Singer.
