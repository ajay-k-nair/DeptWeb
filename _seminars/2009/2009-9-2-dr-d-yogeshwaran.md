Consider a system of N interacting particles evolving over time with 
Markovian dynamics. The interaction occurs only due to a shared resource. 
I shall briefly sketch the classical tightness-existence-uniqueness 
approach used to prove weak convergence of the system to a limiting system 
as N tends to infinity. I shall illustrate another approach in more detail 
with the example of a nonlinear Markov chain. In the case of exchangeable 
particles, weak convergence of the system implies propogation of chaos 
i.e, in the limiting system particles evolve independently due to a 
deterministically shared resource.
