We will investigate the large deviation rates for sums of the form $\sum\_i f(x\_i) g(x\_{2i})$ where $\\{x\_i\\}$ is a nice Markov process. In other words calculate $$\lim\_{n\to\infty}{1\over n}\log E[\exp\sum\_{i=1}^n f(x\_i) g(x\_{2i})]$$ where $\\{x\_i\\}$ is Markov Chain with transition probability $\pi(x, y)$.
