We will investigate the large deviation rates  for sums of the form
$\\sum_i f(x_i)g(x_2i)$ where $\\{x_i\\}$ is a nice Markov process. In
other words "calculate"
$$ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}{1\\over n}\\log E[\\exp\\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i) g(x_2i)]$$
where $\\{x_i\\}$ is Markov Chain with transition probability $\\pi(x, y)$.
