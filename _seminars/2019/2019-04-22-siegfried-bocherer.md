Modular forms are characterized by certain transformation laws.
In general, these properties are not preserved by (holomorphic)
differentiation. I will discuss several ways to overcome this trouble:
Analytically one can use non-holomorphic differential operators 
(''Maaß-Shimura operators'') or use bilinear holomorphic differential 
operators (''Rankin brackets''). More arithmetically, one can show that 
derivatives of modular forms are still congruent to modular forms 
(''Ramanujan's $\theta$-operators''). I will describe the connection between the analytic 
and the arithmetic aspects with focus on some recent  results on $\theta$-operators.
