The Pick--Nevanlinna problem refers to the problem of -- given two connected
open sets in complex Euclidean spaces and finite sets of distinct points in
each -- characterizing (in terms of the given point data) the existence of a
holomorphic map between the two sets that interpolates the given points. The
problem gets its name from Pick -- who provided a beautiful characterization
for the existence of an interpolant when the domain and the co-domain are the
unit disc -- and from Nevanlinna, who rediscovered Pick's result. This
characterization is in terms of matrix positivity. I shall begin by presenting
an easy argument by Sarason, which he says is already implicit in Nevanlinna's
work, for the necessity of the Pick--Nevanlinna condition. How does one prove
the sufficiency of the latter condition? Sarason's ideas have provided the
framework for a long chain of complicated characterizations for the more
general problem. The last word on this is still to be written. But in the
original set-up of Pick, geometry provides the ​answer. Surprisingly, Pick did
not notice that his approach provides a very clean solution to the interpolation
problem where the co-domain is any Euclidean ball. We shall see a proof of the latter.
This proof uses a general observation about conditional positivity (which also made an
appearance in the previous talk)​, which is attributed to Schur. If time permits, we
shall see what can be said when the co-domain is a bounded symmetric domain.
