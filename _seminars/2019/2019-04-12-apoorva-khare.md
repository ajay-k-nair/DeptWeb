I will present a historical account of some work of Schoenberg
in metric geometry: from his metric space embeddings into
Euclidean space and into spheres (_Ann. of Math._ 1935), to his
characterization of positive definite functions on spheres
(_Duke Math. J._ 1942). It turns out these results can be
viewed alternately in terms of matrix positivity: from one of
the first appearances of matrix positivity in analysis, to the
classification of entrywise positivity preservers in all
dimensions.
