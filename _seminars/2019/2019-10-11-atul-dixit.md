Modular forms are certain functions defined on the upper half plane that
transform nicely under $z\to -1/z$ as well as $z\to z+1$. By a modular
relation (or a modular-type transformation) for a certain function $F$,
we mean that which is governed by only the first map, i.e., $z\to -1/z$.
Equivalently, the relation can be written in the form $F(\alpha)=F(\beta)$,
where $\alpha \beta = 1$. There are many generalized modular relations in
the literature such as the general theta transformation $F(w,\alpha) =
F(iw, \beta)$ or other relations of the form $F(z, \alpha) = F(z, \beta)$
etc. The famous Ramanujan-Guinand formula, equivalent to the functional
equation of the non-holomorphic Eisenstein series on ${\rm SL}\_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$,
admits a beautiful generalization of the form $F(z, w,\alpha) = F(z, iw, \beta)$
recently obtained by Kesarwani, Moll and the speaker. This implies that one
can superimpose the theta structure on the Ramanujan-Guinand formula.

The current work arose from answering a similar question - can we
superimpose the theta structure on a recent modular relation involving
infinite series of the Hurwitz zeta function $\zeta(z, a)$ which
generalizes an important result of Ramanujan? In the course of answering
this question in the affirmative, we were led to a surprising new
generalization of $\zeta(z, a)$. This new zeta function, $\zeta_w(z, a)$,
satisfies interesting properties, albeit they are much more difficult to
derive than the corresponding ones for $\zeta(z, a)$. In this talk, I
will briefly discuss the theory of the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(z)$,
the Hurwitz zeta function $\zeta(z, a)$ and then describe the theory of
$\zeta_w(z, a)$ that we have developed. In order to obtain the
generalized modular relation (with the theta structure) satisfied by
$\zeta_w(z, a)$, one not only needs this theory but also has to develop
the theory of reciprocal functions in a certain kernel involving Bessel
functions as well as the theory of a generalized modified Bessel
function. (Based on joint work with Rahul Kumar.)
