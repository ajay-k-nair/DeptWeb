Consider a Monge–Kantorovich problem of transporting densities with a strictly
convex cost function. The entropic relaxation cost is known to converge to the cost of optimal
transport. We are interested in the difference between the two, suitably scaled. We show that
this limit is always given by the relative entropy of the target density with respect to a
Riemannian volume measure that measures the local sensitivity of the Monge map. In the special
case of the quadratic Wasserstein transport, this relative entropy is exactly one half of the
difference of entropies of the target and initial densities. The proofs are based of Gaussian
approximations to Schrödinger bridges which can be interpreted as a higher order large deviation.
