**Lecture 1:** _An introduction to Monge–Kantorovich optimal transport and entropic relaxations_

**Abstract:** The mathematics of Monge–Kantorovich optimal transport (OT) has grown to be a
unifying theme in many scientific disciplines, from purely mathematical areas such as analysis,
geometry, and probability to revolutionary new methods in economics, statistics, machine learning
and artificial intelligence. Much of these are due to impressive leaps in computational methods
in OT that hinge on entropy based approximations. For dynamical OT such relaxations correspond
to stochastic processes called Schr\"odinger bridges. This is an introductory talk on OT, entropic
relaxations, and Schr\"odinger bridges that will attempt to give a flavor of this "hot area" by
sewing through various recent advances.

**Lecture 2:** _On the difference between entropic cost and the optimal transport cost_

**Abstract:** Consider a Monge–Kantorovich problem of transporting densities with a strictly
convex cost function. The entropic relaxation cost is known to converge to the cost of optimal
transport. We are interested in the difference between the two, suitably scaled. We show that
this limit is always given by the relative entropy of the target density with respect to a
Riemannian volume measure that measures the local sensitivity of the Monge map. In the special
case of the quadratic Wasserstein transport, this relative entropy is exactly one half of the
difference of entropies of the target and initial densities. The proofs are based of Gaussian
approximations to Schr\"{o}dinger bridges which can be interpreted as a higher order large deviation.
