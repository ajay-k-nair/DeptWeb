In the first part of the talk we would discuss a topic about the Fourier coefficients of modular forms. Namely, we would focus on the question of distinguishing two modular forms by certain `arithmetically interesting' Fourier coefficients. These type of results are knownas `recognition results' and have been a useful theme in the theory of modular forms,having lots of applications. As an example we would recall the Sturm's bound (which applies quite generally to a wide class of modular forms), which says that two modular forms are equal if (in a suitable sense) their `first' few Fourier coefficients agree. As another  example we would mention the classical multiplicity-one result for elliptic new forms of integral weight, which says that if two such forms $f_1,f_2$ have the same eigenvalues of the $p$-th Hecke operator $T_p$ for almost all primes $p$, then $f_1=f_2$.

The heart of the first part of the talk would concentrate on Hermitian cusp forms of

degree $2$. These objects have a Fourier expansion indexed by certain matrices of size $2$ over an imaginary quadratic field. We show that Hermitian cusp forms of weight $k$ for the Hermitian modular group of degree $2$ are determined by their Fourier coefficients indexed by matrices whose determinants are essentially square--free. Moreover, we give a quantitative version of the above result. This is a consequence of the corresponding results for integral weight elliptic cusp forms, which will also be discussed. This result was established by A. Saha in the context of Siegel modular forms -- and played a crucial role (among others) in the automorphic transfer from $GSp(4)$ to $GL(4)$.

We expect similar applications. We also discuss few results on the square--free Fourier coefficients of elliptic cusp forms.

In the second part of the talk we introduce Saito--Kurokawa lifts: these are certain Siegel modular forms lifted from classical elliptic modular forms on the upper half plane $\mf H$. If $g$ is such an elliptic modular form of integral weight $k$ on $SL(2, Z)$ then we consider its Saito--Kurokawa lift $F_g$ and a certain `restricted' $L^2$-norm, which we denote by $N(F_g)$ (and which we refer to as the `mass'), associated with it.

Pullback of a Siegel modular form $F((\tau,z,z,\tau'))$ ($(\tau,z,z,\tau')$ in Siegel's upper half-plane of degree 2) to $H \times  H$ is its restriction to $z=0$, which we denote by $F|_{z=0}$. Deep conjectures of Ikeda (also known as `conjectures on the periods of automorphic forms') relate the $L^2$-norms of such pullbacks to central values of $L$-functions

for all degrees.

In fact, when a Siegel modular form arises as a Saito--Kurokawa lift (say $F=F_g$), results of Ichino relate the mass of the pullbacks to the central values of certain $GL(3) \times GL(2)$ $L$-functions. Moreover, it has been observed that comparison of the (normalized) norm of $F_g$ with the norm of its pullback provides a measure of concentration of $F_g$ along $z=0$. We recall certain conjectures pertaining to the size of the `mass'. We use the amplification method

to improve the currently known bound for $N(F_g)$.
