The mathematics of Monge–Kantorovich optimal transport (OT) has grown to be a
unifying theme in many scientific disciplines, from purely mathematical areas such as analysis,
geometry, and probability to revolutionary new methods in economics, statistics, machine learning
and artificial intelligence. Much of these are due to impressive leaps in computational methods
in OT that hinge on entropy based approximations. For dynamical OT such relaxations correspond
to stochastic processes called Schrödinger bridges. This is an introductory talk on OT, entropic
relaxations, and Schrödinger bridges that will attempt to give a flavor of this "hot area" by
sewing through various recent advances.
