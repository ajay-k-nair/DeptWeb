This talk will be a continuation of my presentation on 'Factorization
of Contractions', which was held at the in-house symposium this year. 

We will start by proving the celebrated theorem of Berger, Coburn and
Lebow on pairs of commuting isometries which states that:
a pure isometry $V$ on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ is a product of
two commuting isometries $V_1$ and $V_2$ in
$\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ if and only if there exist a Hilbert
space $\mathcal{E}$, a unitary $U$ in $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{E})$ and
an orthogonal projection $P$ in $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{E})$ such that
$(V, V_1, V_2)$ and $(M_z, M_{\Phi}, M_{\Psi})$ on
$H^2_{\mathcal{E}}(\mathbb{D})$ are unitarily equivalent, where

$$
\Phi(z)=(P+zP^{\perp})U^* \quad \text{and} \quad
\Psi(z)=U(P^{\perp}+zP) \quad \quad (z \in \mathbb{D}).
$$

Followed by proving the similar factorization result for pure contractions.
More particularly, let $T$ be a pure contraction on a Hilbert space
$\mathcal{H}$ and let $P_{\mathcal{Q}} M_z|\_{\mathcal{Q}}$ be the Sz.-Nagy and Foias
representation of $T$ for some canonical
$\mathcal{Q} \subseteq H^2\_{\mathcal{D}}(\mathbb{D})$.
Then $T = T_1 T_2$, for some commuting contractions $T_1$ and $T_2$ on
$\mathcal{H}$, if and only if there exist $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{D})$-valued
polynomials $\varphi$ and $\psi$ of degree $\leq 1$ such that
$\mathcal{Q}$ is a joint ($M^\*_{\varphi}, M^\*_{\psi}$)-invariant subspace and

$$
P_{\mathcal{Q}} M_z\mid_{\mathcal{Q}} = P_{\mathcal{Q}} M_{\varphi
\psi}|\_{\mathcal{Q}} = P_{\mathcal{Q}} M_{\psi
\varphi}|\_{\mathcal{Q}} \quad \mbox{and} \quad (T_1, T_2) \cong
(P_{\mathcal{Q}} M_{\varphi}|\_{\mathcal{Q}}, P_{\mathcal{Q}}
M_{\psi}|\_{\mathcal{Q}}).
$$

Moreover, there exist a Hilbert space $\mathcal{E}$ and an isometry
$V \in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{D}; \mathcal{E})$ such that

$$
\varphi(z) = V^* \Phi(z) V \mbox{ and } \psi(z) =
V^* \Psi(z) V \quad \quad (z \in \mathbb{D}),
$$

where the pair $(\Phi, \Psi)$, as defined above, is the Berger,
Coburn and Lebow representation of a pure pair of commuting
isometries on $H^2\_{\mathcal{E}}(\mathbb{D})$. As an application, we shall obtain a
sharper von Neumann inequality for commuting pairs of contractions.

If time permits, then we will look at some of the recent work by other authors
in this direction and also try to figure out the challenges that lie in extending
this result to a tuple of contractions.
