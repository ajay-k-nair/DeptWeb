Given a closed orientable surface $S$, an $(G,X)-$structure on $S$ is the datum of a maximal atlas whose charts tale values 
on X and transition functions are restrictions of elements in G. Any such a structure induces a holonony representation 
$\rho:\pi_1\widetilde{S}\to X$ which encoded geometric data of the structure. Conversely, can we recover a geometric
structure from a given representation? Is such a structure unique? In this talk we answer to these questions by providing 
old and new results.
