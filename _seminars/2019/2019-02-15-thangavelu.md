Mathematical analysts seem to have an obsession with inequalities
and they search for them even within equalities! Then they ask for
conditions under which equality holds. They even go to the extent
of quantifying the inequalities and ask for sharp constants. Strange
as it may seem, we demonstrate that this is the case, with several examples.
