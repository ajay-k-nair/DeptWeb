We prove an explicit central value formula for a family of complex L-series
of degree 6 for GL2 Ã— GL3 which arise as factors of certain Garret--Rankin
triple product L-series associated with modular forms. Our result generalizes
a previous formula of Ichino involving Saito--Kurokawa lifts, and as an
application, we prove Deligne's conjecture about the algebraicity of the
central values of the considered L-series up to the relevant periods. I would
also include some other arithmetic applications towards the subconvexity problem, 
construction of associated p-adic L function, etc.

This is joint work with Carlos de Vera Piquero.
