In this thesis we will discuss the properties of the category
$\mathcal{O}$ of left $\mathfrak{g}$-modules having some specific
properties, where $\mathfrak{g}$ is a complex semisimple Lie
algebra. We will also discuss the projective objects of
$\mathcal{O}$, and will establish the fact that each object in
$\mathcal{O}$ is a factor object of a projective object. We will
prove that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the
indecomposable projective objects and simple objects of $\mathcal{O}$.
We will discuss some facts about the full subcategory
$\mathcal{O}_\theta$ of $\mathcal{O}$. And finally we will establish
a relation between the Cartan matrix and the decomposition matrix
with the help of the BGG reciprocity and the fact that each projective
module in $\mathcal{O}$ admits a $p$-filtration.
