Given a group G, we will define conjugacy invariant norm and discuss the boundedness of such norms. 
We will relate this problem with the existence of homogeneous quasimorphisms on groups. If time permits,
we will discuss bounded cohomology and its relation to the above. This talk will be largely self-contained. 
No background of any of the mentioned objects will be required.
