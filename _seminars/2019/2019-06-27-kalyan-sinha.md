Trace is a kind of "special non-commutative integration" and trace formulae attempts
to relate traces of certain expressions, involving operators with associated
geometric/topological quantities. A simple example, involving two orthogonal projections
in a Hilbert space, will be discussed, in which some of these features appear naturally.
