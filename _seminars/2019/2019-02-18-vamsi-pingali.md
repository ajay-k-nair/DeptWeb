Motivated by mirror symmetry considerations (the deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills equation due to Jacobs-Yau) 
and a desire to study stability conditions involving higher chern forms, a vector bundle version of the usual 
complex Monge-Ampere equation (studied by Calabi, Aubin, Yau, etc) will be discussed. I shall also discuss a 
Kobayashi-Hitchin type correspondence for a special case (a dimensional reduction to Riemann surfaces).
