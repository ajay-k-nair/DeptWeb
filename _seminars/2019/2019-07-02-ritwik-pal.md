This talk would have two parts. In the first part, we will discuss some topics
which can be classified as 'Linnik-type' problems (the motivation being his
original question about locating the first prime in an arithmetic progression)
in the context of Hecke eigenvalues of modular forms on various groups, and then
talk about the distribution of their signs. In the second part we will discuss
differential operators on modular forms, and then talk about their applications
to questions about Jacobi forms.

It is well-known that the sequence of Hecke eigenvalues mentioned above are often
real, and has infinitely many sign changes. First part of the talk would discuss
the problem of estimating the location of the first such sign change in the
context of Hecke eigenvalues of Yoshida lifts (a certain subspace of the Siegel
modular forms) and Fourier coefficients of Hilbert modular forms. We show how to
improve the previously best known results on this topic significantly. 

The crucial inputs behind these would be to establish a non-trivial upper bound
on the sum of Hecke eigenvalues of an elliptic newform at primes away from the
level for treating Yoshida lifts; and exploiting Hecke relations along with
generalising related results due to K. Soundararajan, K. Matomaki et al. for the
case of Hilbert modular forms. In both cases we measure the location of the
eigenvalues or Fourier coefficients in terms of an analytic object called the
'analytic conductor', which would be introduced during the talk. Moreover in
the case of Hilbert modular forms, we will also discuss quantitative results
about distribution of positive and negative Hecke eigenvalues. The proof depends
on establishing a certain result on a particular types of multiplicative functions
on the set of integral ideals of a totally real number field.

In the second part of the talk, we will introduce the space of Jacobi forms and
certain results due to J. Kramer and, briefly, a conjecture due to Hashimoto on
theta series attached to quaternion algebras to motivate the results to follow.
The (partial) solution of this conjecture by Arakawa and B\"ocherer transfers the
question to one about differential operators on Jacobi forms, and we would report
on previously known and new results on this topic.

The heart of the second part of the talk would focus on the question about the
differential operators on Jacobi forms. It is well known that certain differential
operators $\{D_{v}\}\_{0}^{2m}$ map the space of Jacobi forms $J_{k,m}(N)$ of weight
$k$, index $m$ and level $N$ to the space of modular forms $M_{k+v}(N)$ of weight
$k+v$ and level $N$. It is also known that the sum of the differential operators
$D_{v}$ for $v=\{1,2,...2m\}$ map $J_{k,m}(N)$ to the direct sum of $M_{k+v}(N)$
injectively. The question alluded to above boils down to investigate whether one
can omit certain differential operators from the list above, maintaining the
injective property. In this regard, we would discuss results of Arakawa--B\"ocherer,
Das--Ramakrishnan, and finally our results. The main point would be to establish
automorphy of the Wronskian of a certain tuple of congruent theta series of weight 3/2.
