The action of the Frobenius on the `$\ell$`-adic cohomology of a variety over a finite field is an interesting invariant of the variety. By the Weil conjectures, the absolute values of the eigenvalues are well understood but this is not the complete story. We study the `$\ell$`-adic properties of these eigenvalues by taking inspiration from Iwasawa theory. We consider towers of curves such as `$y^2 = f(x^{\ell^n})$` over a finite field and prove that the characteristic polynomials of the Frobenius converge in an appropriate sense by proving an abstract non abelian Iwasawa theoretic statement.
