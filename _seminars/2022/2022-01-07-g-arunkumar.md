Let $\mathfrak g$ be a Borcherds algebra with the associated graph $G$.
We prove that the chromatic symmetric function of $G$ can be recovered
from the Weyl denominators of $\mathfrak g$, and this gives a Lie
theoretic proof of Stanley's expression for chromatic symmetric function
in terms of power sum symmetric functions. Also, this gives an expression
for the chromatic symmetric function of $G$ in terms of root
multiplicities of $\mathfrak g$. We prove a modified Weyl denominator
identity for Borcherds algebras which is an extension of the celebrated
classical Weyl denominator identity, and this plays an important role in
the proof our results. The absolute value of the linear coefficient of
the chromatic polynomial of $G$ is known as the chromatic discriminant of
$G$. As an application of our main theorem, we prove that certain
coefficients appearing in the above said expression of chromatic
symmetric function is equal to the chromatic discriminant of $G$. Also,
we find a connection between the Weyl denominators and the $G$-elementary
symmetric functions. Using this connection, we give a Lie-theoretic proof
of non-negativity of coefficients of $G$-power sum symmetric functions. I
will also talk about the plethysms of chromatic symmetric functions.
