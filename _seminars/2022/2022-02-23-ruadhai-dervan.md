 A conjectural correspondence due to Yau, Tian and Donaldson relates the existence of certain canonical Kähler metrics ("constant scalar curvature Kähler metrics") to an algebro-geometric notion of stability ("K-stability"). I will describe a general framework linking geometric PDEs ("Z-critical Kähler metrics") to algebro-geometric stability conditions ("Z-stability"), in such a way that the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture is the classical limit of these new broader conjectures. The main result will prove that a special case of the main conjecture:  the existence of Z-critical Kähler metrics is equivalent to Z-stability.
