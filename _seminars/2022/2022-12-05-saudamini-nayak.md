The theory of Lie superalgebras have many applications in various areas
of Mathematics and Physics. Kac gives a comprehensive description of
mathematical theory of Lie superalgebras, and establishes the
classification of all finite dimensional simple Lie superalgebras over an
algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. In the last few years
the theory of Lie superalgebras has evolved remarkably, obtaining many
results in representation theory and classification. Most of the results
are extension of well known facts of Lie algebras. But the classification
of all finite dimensional nilpotent Lie superalgebras is still an open
problem like that of finite dimensional nilpotent Lie algebras. Till
today nilpotent Lie superalgebras $L$ of $\dim L \leq 5$ over real and
complex fields are known.

Batten introduced and studied Schur multiplier and cover of Lie algebras
and later on studied by several authors. We have extended these notation
to Lie superalgebra case. Given a free presentation $ 0 \longrightarrow R
\longrightarrow F \longrightarrow L \longrightarrow 0 $ of Lie
superalgebra $L$ we define the _multiplier_ of $L$ as $\mathcal{M}(L) =
\frac{[F,F]\cap R}{[F, R]}$. In this talk we prove that for nilpotent Lie
superalgebra $L = L_{\bar{0}} \oplus L_{\bar{1}}$  of dimension $(m\mid
n)$ and $\dim L^2= (r\mid s)$ with $r+s \geq 1$,
\begin{equation}
\dim \mathcal{M}(L)\leq \frac{1}{2}\left[(m + n + r + s - 2)(m + n - r -s -1) \right] + n + 1.
\end{equation}
Moreover, if $r+s = 1$, then the equality holds if and only if $ L \cong
H(1, 0) \oplus A(m-3 \mid n)$
where $A(m-3 \mid n)$ is an abelian Lie superalgebra of dimension $(m-3
\mid n)$,  and $H(1, 0)$ is special Heisenberg Lie superalgebra of
dimension $(3 \mid 0)$. Then we define the function $s(L)$ as 
\begin{equation}
s(L)= \frac{1}{2}(m+n-2)(m+n-1)+n+1-\dim \mathcal{M}(L).
\end{equation}
Clearly $s(L) \geq 0$ and structure of $L$ with $s(L)=0$ is known. We
obtain classification all finite dimensional nilpotent Lie supealgebras
with $s(L) \leq 2$.  
 
We hope, this leads to a complete classification of the finite
dimensional nilpotent Lie superalgebras of dimension $6,7$.
