Given any graph, we can uniquely associate a square matrix which stores informations
about its vertices and how they are interconnected. The goal of spectral graph theory
is to see how the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of such a matrix representation of a
graph are related to the graph structure. We consider here (multi)digraphs and define
a new matrix representation for a multidigraph and named it as the complex adjacency
matrix.

The relationship between the adjacency matrix and the complex adjacency matrix of a
multidigraph are established. Furthermore, some of the advantages of the complex
adjacency matrix over the adjacency matrix of a multidigraph are observed. Besides,
some of the interesting spectral properties (with respect to the complex adjacency
spectra) of a multidigraph are established. It is shown that not only the eigenvalues,
but also the eigenvectors corresponding to the complex adjacency matrix of a multidigraph
carry a lot of information about the structure of the multidigraph.
