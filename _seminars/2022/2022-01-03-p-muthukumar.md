Let $H^2$ denote the Hardy space on the open unit disk $\mathbb{D}$. For
a given holomorphic self map $\varphi$ of $\mathbb{D}$, the composition
operator $C_\varphi$ on $H^2$ is defined by $C_\varphi(f) = f \circ
\varphi$. In this talk, we discuss about Beurling type invariant subspace
of composition operators, that is common invariant subspaces of shift
(multiplication) and composition operators. We will also consider the
model spaces that are invariant under composition operators.
