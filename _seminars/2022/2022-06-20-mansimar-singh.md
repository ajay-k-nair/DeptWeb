The aim of this talk is to understand $\ell$-adic Galois representations and associate them to
normalized Hecke eigenforms of weight $2$. We will also associate these representations to elliptic
curves over $\mathbb{Q}$. This will enable us to state the Modularity Theorem. We will also mention
its special case which was proved by Andrew Wiles and led to the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.

We will develop most of the central objects involved - modular forms, modular curves, elliptic curves,
and Hecke operators, in the talk. We will directly use results from algebraic number theory and
algebraic geometry.
