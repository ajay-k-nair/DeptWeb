In the first part of the talk we will discuss the main statement of local class field theory and
sketch a proof of it. We will then discuss the statement of local Langlands correspondence for
$GL_2(K)$, where $K$ is a non archimedian local field. In the process we will also introduce all
the objects that go in the statement of the correspondence.
