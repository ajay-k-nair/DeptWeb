I will describe the construction of an integer-valued
symplectic invariant counting embedded pseudo-holomorphic curves in a
Calabi--Yau 3-fold in certain cases. This may be seen as an analogue
of the Gromov invariant defined by Taubes for symplectic 4-manifolds.
The construction depends on a detailed bifurcation analysis of the
moduli space of embedded curves along generic paths of almost complex
structures. This is based on joint work with Shaoyun Bai.
