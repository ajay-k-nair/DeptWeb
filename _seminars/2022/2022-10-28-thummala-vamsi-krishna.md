In the first part of the talk we will discuss the main statement of local class field theory
and discuss the statement of Local Langlands correspondence for $GL_2(K)$, where $K$ is a
non-archimedean local field. In the process, we will also introduce all the objects in the
statement of correspondence. We will then discuss a brief sketch of the proof of the main
statement of local class field theory.
