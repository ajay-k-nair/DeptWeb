We consider certain degenerating families of complex manifolds, each carrying a canonical measure (for example, the Bergman measure on a compact Riemann surface of genus at least one). We show that the measure converges, in a suitable sense, to a measure on a non-Archimedean space, in the sense of Berkovich. No knowledge of non-Archimedean geometry will be assumed.
