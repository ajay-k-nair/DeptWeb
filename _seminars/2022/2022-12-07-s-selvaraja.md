In this talk, I will discuss the relation of square-free monomial ideals to combinatorics.
In particular, I will explain some combinatorial invariants of hypergraphs that can be used
to describe the Castelnuovoâ€“Mumford regularity and componentwise linearity of different kinds
of powers of squarefree monomial ideals.
