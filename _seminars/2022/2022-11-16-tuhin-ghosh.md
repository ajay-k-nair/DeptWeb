In this talk, we will discuss the Calder처n type inverse problem of determining
the coefficients of the nonlocal operators. In the mathematical literature, the
method of Electrical Impedance Tomography which consists in determining the
electrical properties of a medium by making voltage and current measurements at
the boundary of the medium is known as Calder처n's problem. We will introduce
the nonlocal analog of it and further study the connection with the local analog
as well.
