For a real number $x$, let $\\|x\\|$ denote the distance from $x$ to the
nearest integer. The study of the sequence $\\|\alpha^n\\|$ for $\alpha > 1$
naturally arises in various contexts in number theory. For example, it is
not known that the sequence $\\|e^n\\|$ tends to zero as $n$ tends to
infinity. Also, the growth of the sequence $\\|(3/2)^n\\|$ is linked to the
famous Waring's problem. This was the motivation for Mahler in 1957 to
prove that for any non-integral rational number $\alpha > 1$ and any real
number $c$ with $0 < c < 1$, the inequality $\\|\alpha^n\\| < c^n$ has only
finitely many solutions in $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Mahler also asked the
characterization of all algebraic numbers satisfying the same property as
the non-integral rational numbers. In 2004, Corvaja and Zannier proved a
Thue-Roth-type inequality with moving targets and as consequence, they
completely answered the above question of Mahler. In this talk, we will
explore this theme and will present recent result, building on the
earlier works of Corvaja and Zannier, establishing an inhomogeneous
Thue-Roth's type theorem with moving targets.
