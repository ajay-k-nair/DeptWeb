One interesting question in low-dimensional topology is to understand the structure of mapping class group of a given manifold. In dimension 2, this topic is very 
well studied. The structure of this group is known for various 3-manifolds as well (ref- Hatcher's famous work on Smale conjecture). But virtually nothing is known
in dimension 4. In this talk I will try to motivate why this problem in dimension 4 is interesting and how it is different from dimension 2 and 3. I will 
demonstrate some "exotic" phenomena and if time permits, I will talk a few words on my work with Jianfeng Lin where we used an idea motivated from this to disprove
a long standing open problem about stabilizations of 4-manifolds.
