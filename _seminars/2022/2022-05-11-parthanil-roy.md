Random fields indexed by amenable groups arise naturally in machine learning algorithms for
structured and dependent data. On the other hand, ergodicity of such fields is an extremely
important tool for investigating asymptotic properties of any method/algorithm in the context
of space-time statistical inference. In this work, we find a necessary and sufficient condition
for ergodicity of a left-stationary symmetric stable random field indexed by an amenable group
in terms of its Rosinski representation. The main challenge is ergodic theoretic - more precisely,
the unavailability of an ergodic theorem for nonsingular (but not necessarily measure preserving)
actions of amenable groups even along a tempered FÃ¸lner sequence. We remove this obstacle with
the help of a truncation argument along with the seminal work of Lindenstrauss (2001) and
Tempelman (2015), and finally applying the Maharam skew-product. This work extends the domain of
application of the speaker's previous paper connecting stable random fields with von Neumann
algebras via the group measure space construction of Murray and von Neumann (1936). In particular,
both ergodicity and complete non-ergodicity have now become $W^\*$-rigid properties for stable
random fields indexed by any amenable group, not just $\mathbb{Z}^d$.

This talk is based on an ongoing joint work with Mahan Mj (TIFR Mumbai) and Sourav Sarkar (University of Cambridge).
