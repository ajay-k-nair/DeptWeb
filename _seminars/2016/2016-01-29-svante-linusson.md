There exists various possible methods to distribute seats 
proportionally between states (or parties) in a parliament. In the first half 
of the talk I will describe some often used methods and discuss their pros and 
cons (it's all in the rounding).

One easy method is called Hamilton's method (also known as the method of 
largest reminder or Hare's method). It suffers from a drawback called the 
Alabama paradox, which e.g. made USA abandon it for the distribution of seats in 
the house of representatives between states. It is still in use in many other 
countries including Sweden.

In the second half of the talk I will describe a joint work with Svante Janson 
(Uppsala Univ.) where we study the probability that the Alabama paradox will 
happen. We give, under certain assumptions, a closed formula for the 
probability that the Alabama paradox occurs given the vector $p_1,\dots,p_m$ of 
relative sizes of the states.
