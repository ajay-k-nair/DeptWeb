Having been unclear how to widely define strong (or strict)
pseudoconvexity in the infinite-dimensional context, we compared the
concept in the smooth-boundary case with strict convexity. As a result, w=
e
accomplished establishing definitions of local uniform pseudoconvexity,
uniform pseudoconvexity and strict pseudoconvexity for open and bounded
subsets of a Banach space. We will see examples of Banach spaces with
uniformly pseudoconvex unit ball, as well as examples of Banach spaces
whose unit ball is not even strictly pseudoconvex. As an application of
the techniques developed, we show that in finite dimension the concept of
strict plurisubharmonicity coincides with strict plurisubharmonicity
in distribution.
