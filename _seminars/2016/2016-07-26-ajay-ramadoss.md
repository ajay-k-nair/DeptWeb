The $n$-dimensional matrix representations of a group or an associative
algebra $A$ form a space (algebraic variety) Rep$(A,n)$ called the $n$-th
representation  variety of $A$. This is a classical geometric invariant that
plays a role in many areas of mathematics. The construction of Rep$(A,n)$ is
natural (functorial) in $A$, but it is not `exact' in the sense of
homological algebra. In this talk, we will
explain how to refine Rep$(A,n)$ by constructing a derived representation
variety DRep$(A,n)$, which is an example of a derived moduli space in
algebraic geometry. For an application, we will look at the classical
varieties of commuting matrices, and present a series of combinatorial
conjectures extending the famous Macdonald conjectures in representation
theory.
