title: "Some Aspects of Minimal Surfaces"
date: 26 February, 2016
time:  2:15 â€“ 3:15 pm
venue: LH-1, Mathematics Department
series: "Eigenfunctions Seminar"

I will introduce minimal surfaces and explain the 
Weierstrass-Enneper representation of a minimal surface using hodographic 
coordinates. I will mention an interesting link between minimal surfaces 
and Born-Infeld solitons. If time permits, I will explain my work (with P. Kumar 
and R.K. Singh) on interpolation of two real analytic curves by a minimal 
surface of the Bjorling-Schwartz type.
