A classical theorem in Riemannian geometry asserts that products of 
compact manifolds cannot admit Riemannian metrics with negative sectional 
curvature. A fibration (or a fibre bundle) is a natural generalization of a 
product and hence one can ask if a fibration can admit such a metric. This 
question is still open and I will discuss it in the context of Kahler 
manifolds. This leads to the study of graphs of holomorphic motions, which 
originally arose in complex dynamics. I will sketch a proof that the graph 
cannot be biholomorphic to a ball or more generally, a strongly pseudoconvex 
domain.
