title: "The Batalin-Vilkovisky structure on a model of the loop space homology."
time: "3 pm"

Let X be a closed,  simply connected and  orientable manifold of
dimension m and
LX the space of free loops on X.  We use Rational Homotopy Theory to
construct a
model
for the loop space homology. We further define a BV structure  which is
equivalent,
in some
cases,  to the Chas-Sullivan  BV operator.
