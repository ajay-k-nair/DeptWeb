Eigenvalues and eigenvectors appear in many physical and engineering 
problems, beginning with the  noted  study by Euler in 1751 of the kinematics 
of rigid bodies. From a mathematical point of view, for an operator of a 
suitable class, acting in a vector space, its point spectrum and associated 
subspaces refer to its "eigenvalues and eigenvectors", while the subspaces 
associated with the continuous spectrum of the operator is said to consist of 
"eigenfunctions". The basic ideas will be discussed mostly through examples, in 
some of which a natural connection with the representation of appropriate 
groups lurks behind.
