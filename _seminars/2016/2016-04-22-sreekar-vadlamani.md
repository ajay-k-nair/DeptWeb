One of the earliest instance of integral geometric discussion can be 
traced back to Buffon through the "needle problem". The solution, as we know 
now, is based on a platform of theory of measures on geometrical spaces which 
are invariant under some group operations.
In this talk, we shall walk through this subject by following a specific line 
of problems/results called "kinematic fundamental formulae" by studying some 
specific examples.
