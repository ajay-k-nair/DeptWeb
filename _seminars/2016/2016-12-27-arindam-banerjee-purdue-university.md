Given any finite simple graph G one can naturally associate two ideals, namely the edge ideal I(G) and the binomial edge ideal J_G in suitable polynomial rings. In this talk we shall discuss the interplay between combinatorics of the graph and depth and regularity of I(G), J_G and their powers. Some recent progress and some open problems will be discussed.
