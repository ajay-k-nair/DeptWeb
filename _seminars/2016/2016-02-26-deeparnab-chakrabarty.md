Owing to several applications in large scale learning and vision 
problems, fast submodular function minimization (SFM) has become a very 
important problem. Theoretically, unconstrained SFM is polynomial time 
solvable, however, these algorithms are not practical. In 1976, Wolfe proposed 
a heuristic for projection onto a polytope, and in 1980, Fujishige showed how 
Wolfe's heuristic can be used for SFM. For general submodular functions, this 
Fujishige-Wolfe heuristic seems to have the best empirical performance. Despite 
its good practical performance, very little is known about Wolfe's projection 
algorithm theoretically.

In this talk, I will describe the first analysis which proves that the 
heuristic is polynomial time for bounded submodular functions. Our work 
involves the first convergence analysis of Wolfe’s projection heuristic, and 
proving a robust version of Fujishige’s reduction theorem.
