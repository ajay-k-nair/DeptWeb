Inverse spectral theory in one dimension is to recover a 
self-adjoint operator given its spectrum and some spectral measure.  In general 
there are lots of self-adjoint operators (of a given form) this collection is 
called an iso-spectral set.  We will give a brief introduction to the questions 
in this area and also some connections to other areas of mathematics.
