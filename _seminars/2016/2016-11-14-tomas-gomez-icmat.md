The Deligne-Hitchin moduli space is a partial compactification

of the moduli space of $\\lambda$-connections. It includes as closed

subvarieties the moduli spaces of Hitchin bundles ($\\lambda=0$) and of

holomorphic connections ($\\lambda=1$), exhibiting the later as a

deformation of the former. We show a Torelli theorem for a parabolic
version of this moduli space (joint work with David Alfaya). I will try to
make the talk accessible to a wide mathematical audience.
