We will present results obtained in collaboration with J. Burgos and M. Sombra. These extend the well known dictionary between the geometric properties of toric varieties and convex geometry. In particular, we give combinatorial descriptions of classical invariants of arithmetic geometry, such as metric, height or essential minimum.
