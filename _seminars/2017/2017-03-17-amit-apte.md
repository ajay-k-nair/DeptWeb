time:  2:15 â€“ 3:15 pm
venue: LH-1, Mathematics Department
series: "Eigenfunctions Seminar"

I will introduce the concepts of backward, forward, and
covariant Lyapunov vectors (that are basically "eigenfunctions" of certain
operators) for a dynamical system and discuss their relevance in studying
various stability results, both for the system itself and for nonlinear
filtering problem, which will also be introduced along the way. The
"relevance" to nonlinear filters is in the form of open questions whose
answers (as a set of conjectures) may be gleaned from numerical results
and linear filtering theory.
