It is known that the characteristic function $\theta_T$ of a
homogeneous contraction $T$ with an associated representation $\pi$ is of
the form

$$\theta_T(a) = \sigma_{L}(\phi_a)^{*} \theta(0) \sigma_{R}(\phi_a),$$

where, `$\sigma_{L}$` and `$\sigma_{R}$` are projective representation of the
Mobius group Mob with a common multiplier. We give another proof
of the ``product formula''.
Also, we prove that the projective representations `$\sigma_L$` and
`$\sigma_R$` for a class of multiplication operators, the two
representations `$\sigma_{R}$` and `$\sigma_{L}$` are unitarily equivalent to
certain known pair of representations $\sigma_{\lambda + 1}$` and
`$\sigma_{\lambda - 1},$` respectively. These are described explicitly.

Let $G$ be either (i) the direct product of $n$-copies of the
bi-holomorphic automorphism group of the disc or (ii) the bi-holomorphic
automorphism group of the polydisc `$\mathbb D^n.$`
A commuting tuple of bounded operators `$\mathsf{T} = (T_1, T_2,\ldots
,T_n)$` is said to be $G$-homogeneous if the joint spectrum of `$\mathsf{T}$`
lies in `$\widebar{\mathbb{D}}^n$` and `$\varphi(\mathsf{T}),$` defined using
the usual functional calculus, is unitarily equivalent with $\mathsf{T}$
for all `$\varphi \in G.$`

We show that a commuting tuple `$\mathsf{T}$` in the Cowen-Douglas class of
rank $1$ is $G$ - homogeneous if and only if it is unitarily equivalent
to the tuple of the multiplication operators on either the reproducing
kernel Hilbert space with reproducing kernel `$\prod_{i = 1}^{n}
\frac{1}{(1 - z_{i}\overline{w}_{i})^{\lambda_i}}$ or $\prod_{i = 1}^{n}
\frac{1}{(1 - z_{i}\overline{w}_{i})^{\lambda}},$` where `$\lambda,$`
`$\lambda_i$`, `$1 \leq i \leq n,$` are positive real numbers, according as
$G$ is as in (i) or (ii).

Let `$\mathsf T:=(T_1, \ldots ,T_{n-1})$` be a $G$-homogeneous $(n-1)$-tuple
of rank $1$ Cowen-Douglas class, where $G$ is the the direct product of
$n-1$-copies of the bi-holomorphic automorphism group of the disc. Let
`$\hat{T}$` be an irreducible homogeneous (with respect to the
bi-holomorphic group of automorphisms of the disc) operator in the
Cowen-Douglas class on the disc of rank $2$. We show that every
irreducible $G$ - homogeneous operator, $G$ as in (i), of rank $2$ must be
of the form $$(T_1\otimes I_{\widehat{H}},\ldots , T_{n-1}\otimes
I_{\widehat{H}}, I_H \otimes \hat{T}).$$

We also show that if $G$ is chosen to be the group as in (ii), then there
are no irreducible $G$- homogeneous operators of rank $2.$
