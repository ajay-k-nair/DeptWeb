Given n random points on a manifold embedded in a Euclidean
space, we wish to understand what topological features of the manifold can
be inferred from the geometry of these points. One procedure is to
consider union of Euclidean balls of radius r around the points and study
the topology of this random set (i.e., the union of balls). A more robust
method (known as persistent homology) of inferring the topology of the
underlying manifold is to study the evolution of topology of the random
set as r varies. What topological information (for example, Betti numbers and
some generalizations) about the underlying manifold can we glean for
different choices of r ?  This question along with some partial answers in
the recent years will be the focus of the talk. I shall try to keep the
talk mostly self-contained assuming only knowledge of basic probability
and point-set topology.
