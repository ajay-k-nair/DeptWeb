Given a metric space (X, d), there are several notions of it
being negatively curved. In this talk, we single out certain consequences
of negative curvature -- which are themselves weaker than (X, d) being
negatively curved -- that turn out to be very useful in proving results
about holomorphic maps. We shall illustrate what this means by giving a
proof of the Wolff-Denjoy theorem. (This theorem says that given a
holomorphic self-map f of the open unit disc, either f has a fixed point
in the open unit disc or there exists a point p on the unit circle such
that ALL orbits under the successive iterates of f approach p.) For most
of this talk, we shall focus on metric spaces or on geometry in one
complex variable. Towards the end, we shall briefly point out what can be
proved in domains in higher dimensions that have the aforementioned
negative-curvature-type properties. This part of the talk is joint work
with Andrew Zimmer.
