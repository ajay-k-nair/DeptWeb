Derived category is an important tool in homological algebra invented by Grothendieck and Verdier. In these days derived categories play important roles in 
 
many areas of algebraic geometry. In this talk, I will discuss derived categories and 
their applications to study Ulrich bundles on some Fano manifolds.
