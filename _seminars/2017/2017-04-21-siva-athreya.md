We shall consider sampling procedures to construct subgraphs to
infer properties of a network. Specifically, we shall consider sampling
procedures in the context of dense and sparse graph  limits. We will
explore open questions and interesting explorations at the undergraduate
level. The talk will be accessible to a general audience.
