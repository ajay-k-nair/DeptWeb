A partition of integer $n$ is a sequence $\\lambda =  (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\cdots, \\lambda_k, \\cdots)$ of 
non negative integers such that $\\lambda\_i \\ge \\lambda\_{i+1}$ and $\\sum\_i \\lambda\_i = n$. 
It follows that there are finitely many non-zero $\\lambda\_i$'s. One can restrict the number of them and the 
largest value of $\\lambda\_i$ and observe that the set of such partitions form a poset under a suitable relation. 
Several  natural questions arise in this setting.  Some of these questions have been answered by Proctor, 
Stanley and Kathy O'Hara among others. 
We take a look at some techniques as given by Stanley and ask if it is possible to extend it to  higher dimensions.
