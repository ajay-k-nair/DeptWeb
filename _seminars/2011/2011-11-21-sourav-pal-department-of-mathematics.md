In this talk, we shall define $\\\\Gamma$-contractions, which were introduced by Jim Agler and Nicholas Young. We shall construct an explicit $\\\\Gamma$-isometric dilation of a $\\\\Gamma$-contraction and produce a genuine functional model. A crucial operator equation has to be solved for constructing such a dilation. We shall show how the existence of such a solution characterizes a $\\\\Gamma$-contraction. This solution, which is unique, also provides a complete unitary invariant.
