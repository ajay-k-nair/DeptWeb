Heuristics indicate that point processes exhibiting clustering of points
have larger critical radii for the percolation of their continuum
percolation models than spatially homogeneous point processes. I will
explain why the dcx ordering of point processes is suitable to compare
their clustering tendencies. Hence, it is tempting to conjecture that
the critical radius is increasing in dcx order. We will prove the
conjecture for some non-standard critical radii; however it is false
for the standard critical radii. I will discuss the implications of
these results. A powerful implication is that point processes dcx-smaller
than a homogeneous Poisson point process admit uniformly non-degenerate
lower and upper bounds on their critical radii. In fact, all the above
results hold under weaker assumptions of ordering of moment measures and
void probabilities of the point processes. Examples of point processes
comparable to Poisson point processes in this weaker sense include
determinantal and permanental point processes with trace-class integral
kernels. Perturbed lattices are the most general examples of dcx sub- and
super-Poisson point processes. More generally, we show that point
processes dcx-smaller than a homogeneous Poisson point process exhibit
phase transitions in certain percolation models based on the level-sets
of additive shot-noise fields of these point process. Examples of such
models are k-percolation and SINR-percolation. This is a joint work with
Bartek Blaszczyszyn.
