This thesis studies the mixing times for three random walk models. Specifically,
these are the random walks on the alternating group, the group of signed permutations
and the complete monomial group. The details for the models are given below:

_The random walk on the alternating group:_ We investigate the properties of a random
walk on the alternating group $A_n$ generated by $3$-cycles of the form $(i,n-1,n)$
and $(i,n,n-1)$. We call this the _transpose top-$2$ with random shuffle_. We
find the spectrum of the transition matrix of this shuffle. We obtain the sharp mixing
time by proving the total variation cutoff phenomenon at $\left(n-\frac{3}{2}\right)\log n$
for this shuffle.

_The random walk on the group of signed permutations:_ We consider a random walk on the
hyperoctahedral group $B_n$ generated by the signed permutations of the form $(i,n)$
and $(-i,n)$ for $1\leq i\leq n$. We call this the _flip-transpose top with random shuffle_
on $B_n$. We find the spectrum of the transition probability matrix for this shuffle. We
prove that this shuffle exhibits the total variation cutoff phenomenon with cutoff time
$n\log n$. Furthermore, we show that a similar random walk on the demihyperoctahedral
group $D_n$ generated by the identity signed permutation and the signed permutations of
the form $(i,n)$ and $(-i,n)$ for $1\leq i< n$ also has a cutoff at $\left(n-\frac{1}{2}\right)\log n$.

_The random walk on the complete monomial group:_ Let $G_1\subseteq\cdots\subseteq G_n \subseteq\cdots$
be a sequence of finite groups with $|G_1|>2$. We study the properties of a random walk on the
complete monomial group $G_n \wr S_n$ generated by the elements of the form ($e,\dots,e,g;$id)
and $(e,\dots,e,g^{-1},e,\dots,e,g;(i,n))$ for $g\in G_n$, $1\leq i< n$. We call this the
_warp-transpose top with random shuffle_ on $G_n \wr S_n$. We find the spectrum of the transition
probability matrix for this shuffle. We show that this shuffle satisfies cutoff phenomenon with cutoff
time $n\log n$ if and only if $|G_n|=o(n^\delta)$ for all $\delta>0$. We also prove that the mixing
time for this shuffle is of order $n\log n+\frac{1}{2}n\log (|G_n|-1)$.
