This talk broadly has two parts. The first one is about the signs of
Hecke eigenvalues of modular forms and the second is about a problem
on certain holomorphic differential operators on the space of Jacobi
forms. 

In the first part we will briefly discuss how the statistics of signs
of newforms determine them (work of Matomaki-Soundararajan-Kowalski)
and then introduce certain ‘Linnik-type’ problems (the original problem
was concerning the size of the smallest prime in an arithmetic
progression in terms of the modulus) which ask for the size of the first
negative eigenvalue (in terms of the analytic conductor) of various types
modular forms, which has seen a lot of recent interest. Also specifically
we will discuss the problem in the context of Yoshida lifts (a certain
subspace of the Siegel modular forms), where in the thesis, we have
improved upon the previously known result on this topic significantly.
We will prove that the smallest $n$ with $\lambda(n)<0$ satisfy
$n < Q_{F}^{1/2-2\theta+\epsilon}$, where $Q_{F}$ is the analytic 
conductor of a Yoshida lift $F$ and $0<\theta <1/4$ is some constant. 
The crucial point is establishing a non-trivial upper bound on the sum of
Hecke eigenvalues of an elliptic newform at primes away from the level. 

We will focus on a similar question concerning the first negative Fourier
coefficient of a Hilbert newform. If ${C(\mathfrak{m})}\_{\mathfrak{m}}$
denotes the Fourier coefficients of a Hilbert newform $f$, then we show
that the smallest among the norms of ideals $\mathfrak{m}$ such that
$ C(\mathfrak{m})<0$, is bounded by $Q_{f}^{9/20+\epsilon}$ when the
weight vector of $f$ is even and $Q_{f}^{1/2+\epsilon}$ otherwise.
This improves the previously known result on this problem significantly.
Here we would show how to use certain ‘good’ Hecke relations among
the eigenvalues and some standard tools from analytic number theory to
achieve our goal. 

Finally we would talk about the statistical distribution of the signs of
the Fourier coefficients of a Hilbert newform and essentially prove that
asymptotically, half of them are positive and half negative. This was a
breakthrough result of Matomaki-Radziwill for elliptic modular forms,
and our results are inspired by those. The proof hinges on establishing
some of their machinery of averages multiplicative functions to the
number field setting.

In the second part of the talk we will introduce Jacobi forms and certain
differential operators indexed by $\\{D_{v}\\}\_{0}^{2m}$ that maps the
space of Jacobi forms $J_{k,m}(N)$ of weight $k$, index $m$ and level $N$
to the space of modular forms $M_{k+v}(N)$ of weight $k+v$ and level $N$.
It is also known that the direct sum of the differential operators $D_{v}$
for $v=\{1,2,...,2m\}$ maps $J_{k,m}(N)$ to the direct sum of $M_{k+v}(N)$
injectively. Inspired by certain conjectures of Hashimoto on theta series,
S. Bocherer raised the question whether any of the differential operators
be removed from that map while preserving the injectivity. In the case of
even weights S. Das and B. Ramakrishnan show that it is possible to remove
the last operator. In the talk we will discuss the case of the odd weights
and prove a similar result. The crucial step (and the main difference from
the even weight case) in the proof is to establish that a certain tuple of
congruent theta series is a vector valued modular form and finding the
automorphy of the Wronskian of this tuple of theta series.
