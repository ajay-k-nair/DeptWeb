It is commonly expected that $e$, $\log 2$, $\sqrt{2}$, $\pi$,
among other "classical" numbers, behave, in many respects, like
almost all real numbers. For instance, they are expected to be
normal to base 10, that is, one believes that their decimal
expansion contains every finite block of digits from $\{0,
\ldots , 9\}$. We are very far away from establishing such a
strong assertion. However, there has been some small recent
progress in that direction. After surveying classical results
and problems on normal numbers, we will adopt a point of view
from combinatorics on words and show that the decimal expansions
of $e$, of any irrational algebraic number, and of $\log (1 +
\frac{1}{a})$, for a sufficiently large integer $a$, cannot be
'too simple', in a suitable sense.
