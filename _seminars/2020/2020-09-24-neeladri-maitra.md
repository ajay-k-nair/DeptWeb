The first part of this talk deals with identifying and proving the scaling limit
of a uniform tree with given child sequence. A non-negative sequence of integers
$\mathbf{c}=(c_1, c_2, ..., c_l)$ with sum $l-1$ is called a child sequence for
a rooted tree $t$ on $l$ nodes, if for some ordering $v_1, v_2,..., v_l$ of the
nodes, $v_i$ has exactly $c_i$ many children. Consider for each $n$, a child
sequence $\mathbf{c}^n$ with sum $n-1$, and let $\mathbf{t}\_n$ be the plane tree
with $n$ nodes, which is uniformly distributed over the set of all plane trees
having $\mathbf{c}^n$ as their child sequence. Broutin and Marckert (2012) prove
that under certain assumptions on $\mathbf{c}^n$, the scaling limit of $\mathbf{t}\_n$,
suitably normalized, is the Brownian Continuum Random Tree (BCRT). We consider a
more general setting, where a finite number of vertices of $\mathbf{t}\_n$ are
allowed to have **large** degrees. We prove that the scaling limit of
$\mathbf{t}\_n$ in this regime is the Inhomogeneous Continuum Random Tree (ICRT),
in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. 

In the second part, we look at vacant sets left by random walks on random graphs
via simulations. Cerny, Teixeira and Windisch (2011) proved that for
random $d$-regular graphs, there is a number $u_{\star}$, such that if a random
walk is run up to time $un$ with $u<u_{\star}$, $n$ being the total number of
nodes in the graph, a giant component of size $\text{O}(n)$ of the subgraph
spanned by the vacant nodes i.e. the nodes that are not visited by the random
walk, is seen. Whereas if the random walk is run up to time $un$ with $u>u_{\star}$,
the size of the largest component of the subgraph spanned by the vacant nodes
becomes $\text{o}(n)$. With the help of simulations, we try to investigate whether
there is such a  phenomenon for supercritical configuration models with heavy-tailed
degrees.
