The systematic study of determinantal processes began with
the work of Macchi (1975), and since then it has appeared
in different contexts like random matrix theory (eigenvalues
of random matrices), combinatorics (random spanning tree,
non-intersecting paths), and physics (fermions, repulsion
arising in quantum physics). The defining property of a
determinantal process is that its joint intensities are given
by determinants, which makes it amenable to explicit computations.
One can associate a determinantal process with a finite rank
projection on a separable Hilbert space. Let $H$ and K be two
finite-dimensional subspaces of a Hilbert space, and $P$ and $Q$
be determinantal processes associated with projections on $H$
and $K$, respectively. Lyons (2003) showed that if $H$ is contained
in $K$ then $P$ is stochastically dominated by $Q$. We will give a
simpler proof of Lyons' result which avoids the machinery of
exterior algebra used in the original proof of Lyons and provides
a unified approach of proving the result in discrete as well as
continuous case.

As an application of the above result, we will obtain the stochastic
domination between the largest eigenvalues of Wishart matrix ensembles
$W(N, N)$ and $W(N-1, N+1)$. It is well known that the largest
eigenvalue of Wishart ensemble $W(M, N)$ has the same distribution
as the directed last-passage time $G(M, N)$ on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with the
i.i.d. exponential weight. This was recently used by Basu and Ganguly
to obtain stochastic domination between $G(N, N)$ and $G(N-1, N+1)$.
Similar connections are also known between the largest eigenvalue of
the Meixner ensemble and the directed last-passage time on $\mathbb{Z}^2$
with the i.i.d. geometric weight. We prove another stochastic domination
result, which combined with Lyons' result, gives the stochastic
domination between the eigenvalue processes of Meixner ensembles
$M(N, N)$ and $M(N-1, N+1)$.
