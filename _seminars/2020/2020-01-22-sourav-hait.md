In 1976, E.M. Stein proved $L^p$ bounds for spherical maximal
function on Euclidean space. The lacunary case was dealt on
later by C.P. Calderon in 1979. In a recent paper, M. Lacey
has proved sparse bound for these functions and $L^p$ bounds
will follow immediately as a result.

In this talk, we will look at various maximal functions
corresponding to spherical averages and find sparse bounds for
those functions. We will also observe some weighted and
unweighted estimates that will follow as a consequences.

First, we will show sparse bound for lacunary spherical maximal
function on Heisenberg group . Next we move on to full spherical
maximal function. Then we study lacunary maximal function
corresponding to the spherical average on product of Heisenberg
groups. Finally, we will revisit generalized spherical averages
on Euclidean space and prove sparse bounds for the related maximal
functions.
