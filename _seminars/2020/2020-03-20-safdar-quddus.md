The Cartan homotopy formula was introduced for differentiable manifolds
relating a vector field and its Lie derivative. Reinhart gave an
algebraic analogue over a commutative algebra for $D$ a derivation.
Getzler formulated the same for $A\_\infty$ algebras and for $D$ an
arbitrary cocycle.

We talk about the equivariant Cartan homotopy formula for cross
product $DG$-algebras.
