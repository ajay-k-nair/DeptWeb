Let $\boldsymbol T=(T_1, \ldots , T_d)$ be $d$ -tuple of commuting operators
on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. Assume that $\boldsymbol T$ is hyponormal, 
that is, 
$\big \[\big \[ \boldsymbol T^\*, \boldsymbol T \big \] \big \]
:=\big (\big ( \big \[ T_j^\*,T_i\] \big )\big )$ acting on the $d$-fold
direct sum of the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ is non-negative definite. 
The commutator $\[T_j^\*,T_i\]$, $1\leq i,j \leq d$, of a finitely cyclic and 
hyponormal $d$-tuple is not necessarily compact and therefore the question
 of finding trace inequalities for such a $d$-tuple does not arise. 
A generalization of the Berger-Shaw theorem for commuting tuple $\boldsymbol T$ of
hyponormal operators was obtained by Douglas and Yan decades ago.  We discuss several
examples of this generalization in an attempt to understand if the crucial hypothesis{\rm 
in their theorem requiring the Krull dimension of the Hilbert module over the polynomial
ring defined by the map $p\to p(\boldsymbol T)$, $p\in \mathbb C\[\boldsymbol z\]$, is
optimal or not. Indeed, we find examples $\boldsymbol T$ to show that there a large class
operators for which $\text{trace}\[T_j^\*,T_i\]$, $1\leq j,i \leq d$, is finite but the
$d$-tuple is not finitely polynomially cyclic, which is one of the hypothesis of the
Douglas-Yan theorem. We also introduce the weaker notion of "projectively hyponormal 
operators" and show that the Douglas-Yan theorem remains valid even under this weaker hypothesis. 
However, one might look for a function of 
$ \big \[\big \[ \boldsymbol T^\*, \boldsymbol T \big \] \big \]$ 
which may be in trace class. For this, we define an operator valued determinant of a 
$d\times d$-block operator $\boldsymbol B := \big (\big ( B_{i j} \big ) \big )$ 
by the formula 

$$\text{dEt}\big (\boldsymbol{B}\big ):=\sum_{\sigma, \tau \in \mathfrak S_d} 
\text{sgn}(\sigma)B_{\tau(1),\sigma(\tau(1))}B_{\tau(2),\sigma(\tau(2))},\ldots, 
B_{\tau(d),\sigma(\tau(d))}.$$

It is then natural to investigate the properties of the operator 
$\mbox{dEt}\big (\big \[\big \[ \boldsymbol T^\*, \boldsymbol T \big \]\big \] \big ),$
in this case, $B_{i j} = \[T_j^\*,T_i\]$. 
Indeed, we show that the operator dEt equals the generalized commutator  
$\text{GC} \big (\boldsymbol T^\*, \boldsymbol T \big )$ introduced earlier by 
Helton and Howe. Among other things, we find a trace inequality for the operator 
$\mbox{dEt}\big (\big \[\big \[ \boldsymbol T^\*, \boldsymbol T \big \]\big\] \big ),$ 
after imposing certain growth and cyclicity condition on the operator $\boldsymbol T$, namely,

$$ \text{trace} \big( {\rm dEt} \big( [[ \boldsymbol{T}^*, \boldsymbol{T} ]] \big) \big) \leq m \vartheta d! \prod_{i=1}^{d} \|T_i\|^2 $$

for some $\vartheta \geq 1.$ We give explicit examples illustrating the abstract inequality.
