Generators and relations of graded limits of certain finite-dimensional
irreducible representations of quantum affine algebras have been determined
in recent years. For example, the representations in the Hernandez-Leclerc
category corresponding to cluster variables appear to be certain truncations
of representations for current algebras and tensor products are related to
the notion of fusion products. In this talk, we will discuss some known
results on this topic and study the characters of arbitrary truncated
representations.
