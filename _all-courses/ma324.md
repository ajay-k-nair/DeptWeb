The general theory of holomorphic mappings between bounded domains, automorphisms of bounded
domains, discussions on the non-existence of a classical Riemann Mapping Theorem in several
variables, discussion of the various forms of the one-variable Riemann Mapping Theorem, the
Rosay-Wong Theorem, other Riemann-Rosay-Wong-type results (e.g., the work of Pinchuk) to the
extent that time permits.
