We shall cover a selection of topics in probability theory coming from statistical physics models on the Euclidean lattice. A few possible examples of the models include: Ising model, O(N) model, Gaussian free field, contact process, voter model and exclusion processes.

__Pre-requisites:__ This course will be aimed at  Int-Ph.D. and PhD students working in probability theory and related areas. A course in graduate probability theory is useful, but not absolutely necessary. A student with a strong undergraduate background in probability (i.e., without measure theory) might also find this course accessible.
