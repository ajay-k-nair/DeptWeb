Bochner formula, Laplace comparison, Volume comparison, Heat kernel estimates, Cheng-Yau gradient estimates, Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem, Gromov-Haudorff convergence, epsilon regularity, almost rigidity, quantitative structure theory of Riemannian manifolds with Ricci curvature bounds. If time permits, we will discuss the proof of the co-dimension four conjecture due to Cheeger and Naber.
