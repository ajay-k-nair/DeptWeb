This course is an introduction to standard material in logic, 
based on classical first-order logic, after which it ventures into 
modern treatments of some non-classical logics. Although other proof
methods will be discussed, the emphasis will be on proofs using tableaus.

Topics:

* First-order logic: First-order languages, deduction and truth,
models, Smullyan-style tableaus, completeness and compactness theorems.
* Modal logics: Kripke frames, characterization of frame conditions,
tableaus, completeness, finite model property, decision procedures 
for validity.
* First-order modal logics: Kripke frames with constant and varying domains,
tableaus, rigid and flexible designators, non-designating terms,
definite descriptions, ontological arguments.
* Intuitionistic logic: Kripke frames, tableaus, completeness.
