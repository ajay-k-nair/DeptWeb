This is an introductory course on the foundations of mechanics, focusing mainly on classical mechanics. The laws of classical mechanics are most simply expressed and studied in the language of symplectic geometry. This course can also be viewed as an introduction to symplectic geometry. The role of symmetry in studying mechanical systems will be emphasized.

The core syllabus will consist of Lagrangian mechanics, Hamiltonian mechanics, Hamilton-Jacobi theory, moment maps and symplectic reduction. Additional topics will be drawn from integrable systems, quantum mechanics, hydrodynamics and classical field theory.
