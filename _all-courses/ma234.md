title: Metric Geometry of Spaces and Groups
prereqs:
  - A first course in Topology (can be taken concurrently)

Metric geometry is the study of geometric properties such as
curvature and dimensions in terms of distances, especially  in
contexts where the methods of calculus are unavailable, An important
instance of this is the study of groups viewed as geometric objects,
which constitutes the field of geometric group theory.
         This course will introduce concepts, examples and basic results of
Metric Geometry and Geometric Group theory.
