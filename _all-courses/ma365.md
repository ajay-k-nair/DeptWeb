A course in Gaussian processes. At first we shall study basic facts about Gaussian processes - isoperimetric inequality and concentration, comparison inequalities, boundedness and continuity of Gaussian processes, Gaussian series of functions, etc. Later we specialize to smooth Gaussian processes and their nodal sets , in particular expected length and number of nodal sets, persistence probability and other such results from recent papers of many authors.
