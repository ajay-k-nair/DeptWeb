Linear stability analysis, attractors, limit cycles, Poincare-Bendixson
theorem, relaxation oscillations, elements of bifurcation theory:
saddle-node, transcritical, pitchfork, Hopf bifurcations,
integrability, Hamiltonian systems, Lotka-Volterra equations,
Lyapunov function & direct method for stability, dissipative systems,
Lorenz system, chaos & its measures, Lyapunov exponents, strange
attractors, simple maps, period-doubling bifurcations, Feigenbaum
constants, fractals.
Both flows (continuous time systems) & discrete time systems (simple
maps) will be discussed.
Assignments will include numerical simulations.

Prerequisites, if any: familiarity with linear algebra - matrices, and
ordinary differential equations

Desirable: ability to write codes for solving simple problems.
