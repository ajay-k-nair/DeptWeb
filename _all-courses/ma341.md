  - A course in linear algebra, and a course in real analysis.

This course explores matrix positivity and operations that preserve it. These involve fundamental
questions that have been extensively studied in the mathematics literature over the past century,
and are still being studied owing to modern applications to high-dimensional covariance estimation.
The course will bring together techniques from many different areas: analysis, linear algebra,
combinatorics, and symmetric functions.

__List of topics__ (time permitting):
 __1.__ _The cone of positive semidefinite matrices. Totally positive/non-negative matrices._
 Examples of PSD and TP/TN matrices (Gram, Hankel, Toeplitz, Vandermonde, $\\mathbb{P}_G$). Matrix
identities (Cauchy-Binet, Andreief). Generalized Rayleigh quotients and spectral radius.

__2.__ _Positivity preservers._ Schur product theorem. Polya-Szego observation. Schoenberg’s
theorem. Positive definite functions to correlation matrices. Rudin’s (stronger) theorem.
Herz, Christensen-Ressel. 

__3__ _Fixed-dimension problem._ Introduction and modern motivations. H.L. Vasudeva's theorem
and simplifications. Roger Horn’s theorem and simplifications.
