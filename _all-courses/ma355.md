This course would be a survey of fundamental results as well as current research. Topics will be related to the following areas:  geometric structures on surfaces, hyperbolic 3-manifolds, Riemann surfaces and Teichmüller theory, and will focus on the various interactions between these fields.  Students will be encouraged to explore open-ended questions and/or write related computer programs. The following is the course plan: 


Part I

1. A review of hyperbolic structures on surfaces
2. A review of Teichmüller spaces and mapping class groups
3. The topology of the PSL(2,R) representation variety
4. The notion of a geometric structure or (G,X)-structure on a manifold

Part II 

{:start="5"}
5. Translation structures on a surface
6. Holomorphic 1-forms and their periods
7. An introduction to Teichmüller dynamics

Part III 

{:start="8"}
8. Complex projective structures on a surface
9. Surface group representations into PSL(2,C)
10. The Schwarzian derivative and holomorphic quadratic differentials
11. Measured laminations and Thurston’s grafting theorem

Part IV

{:start="12"}
12. Other geometric structures, including affine structures and real projective structures
13. The case of open surfaces.
