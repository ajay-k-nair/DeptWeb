Reflection groups and their generalisations, Coxeter systems, permutation representations,
reduced words, Bruhat order, Kazhdan-Lusztig theory, Chevalley's theorem, Poincare series,
root systems, classification of	finite and affine Coxeter groups

No prior knowledge of combinatorics or algebra is expected, but we will assume a
familiarity with linear algebra and basics of group theory.
