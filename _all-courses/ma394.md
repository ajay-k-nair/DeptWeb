prereqs:
  "This course is aimed at Ph.D. students from different fields who expect to use discrete probability in their research. Graduate level measure theoretic probability will be useful, but not a requirement. I expect the course will be accessible to advanced undergraduates who have had sufficient exposure to probability."

We shall illustrate some important techniques in studying discrete random structures through a number of examples. The techniques we shall focus on will include (if time permits)

1. the probabilistic method;
2. first and second moment methods, martingale techniques for concentration inequalities;
3. coupling techniques, monotone coupling and censoring techniques;
4. correlation inequalities, FKG and BK inequalities;
5. isoperimetric inequalities, spectral gap, Poincare inequality;
6. Fourier analysis on hypercube, Hypercontractivity, noise sensitivity and sharp threshold phenomenon;
7. Stein's method;
8. entropy and information theoretic techniques.

We shall discuss applications of these techniques in various fields such as Markov chains, percolation, interacting particle systems and random graphs.
