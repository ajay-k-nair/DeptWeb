Arithmetical functions, Primes in Arithmetic Progressions, Prime number
 theorem for arithmetic progressions and zeros of Dirichlet L-functions,
 Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem, Equidistribution, circle method and
 applications (ternary Goldbach in mind), the Large Sieve and applications,
 Brun's theorem on twin primes.

 (Further topics if time permits: more on sieves, automorphic forms and
 L-functions, Hecke's L-functions for number fields, bounds on exponential
 sums etc.)
