                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> We shall discuss one of the most famous problems in Combinatorics; the folklore conjecture that for
                    each prime number p, there is a unique projective plane of order p. The focus will be on the
                    coding theoretic approach to this problem. </p>

                <h5><strong>Title:</strong> The power of cheap tricks: Using combinatorial structure in topological software
                </h5>
                <h5><strong>Time:</strong> <a href="index.html#schedule">10:20 am &ndash; 11:05 am</a> (online) </h5>
                <p>
                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Low-dimensional topology is full of algorithmic problems whose best known running times are exponential, or doubly-exponential, or worse - and in some cases even undecidable. Nevertheless, there is a need to have software that can actually solve these problems in practice, despite the theoretical limitations. For this we use “cheap tricks” - techniques that might not always work, but when they do will give fast, correct and certified results.</p>

                    <p>Combinatorial techniques play an important and powerful role in these tricks. We will talk through some key ideas, including well-structured triangulations, graph structure theory and properties of the dual skeleton, and how these are used in practice to find new results in knot theory, 3-manifold and 4-manifold topology.

                <h5><strong>Title:</strong> Stackedness, tightness, and commutative algebra </h5>
                <h5><strong>Time:</strong> <a href="index.html#schedule">11:30 am &ndash; 12:15 pm</a> (online) </h5>
                <p>
                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Stackedness and tightness are attractive properties of triangulated
                    manifolds, which Basudeb has a lot of contributions to them. These
                    properties are defined from combinatorial and topological point of view,
                    but they actually have a nice connection to commutative algebra theory.
                    In this talk, I will talk how Basudeb's works on stacked and tight
                    triangulations connect to commutative algebra theory. </p>

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this talk, we review the concept of triangulation and quasitoric manifolds.
                    Then, we discuss some explicit triangulation of certain 4-dimensional quasitoric manifolds
                    
                    and 8-dimensional complex projective space. The results are joint work with Basudeb Datta.  </p>

                <h5><strong>Title:</strong> An algorithm to compute the crosscap number of a knot</h5>
                <h5><strong>Time:</strong> <a href="index.html#schedule">2:45 pm &ndash; 3:35 pm</a> </h5>
                <p>
                    <strong>Abstract:</strong>  
                    The crosscap number of a knot is the non-orientable counterpart of its genus. It is defined as the minimum of one minus the Euler characteristic of S, taken over all non-orientable surfaces S bounding the knot. Computing the crosscap number of a knot is tricky, since normal surface theory - the usual tool to prove computability of problems in 3-manifold topology, does not deliver the answer "out-of-the-box".</p>

                    <p>In this talk, I will review the strengths and weaknesses of normal surface theory, focusing on why we need to work to obtain an algorithm to compute the crosscap number. I will then explain the theorem stating that an algorithm due to Burton and Ozlen can be used to give us the answer.</p>
                    
                    <p>This is joint with work with Jaco, Rubinstein, and Tillmann.</p>
