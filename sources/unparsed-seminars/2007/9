                    LH2, Department of Mathematics,
                    Indian Institute of Science

                             on

                    (starting March 5, 2007).

Abstract: In this course, we shall learn some abstract symbolic dynamics
and study their relations with analysis. For a better understanding, we
shall deal with the examples of doubling map and the continued fraction
map on the unit interval. We shall study the notions of measure-preserving
transformations, ergodicity and unique ergodicity in a general setting,
study  alternate definitions and investigate the abovesaid properties for
symbolic dynamics. In the end, we shall see the significance of such
dynamics; how these are used as models to study complex problems in
ergodic theory and dynamical systems.

This course is based on the following books.

1. K.Dajani and C.Kraaikamp, Ergodic theory of numbers, Carus Mathematical
Monographs, 29, 2002.

2. B.Kitchens, Symbolic dynamics: One-sided, two-sided and countable state
Markov shifts, Universitext, Springer-Verlag, 1998.

3. P.Walters, An Introduction to Ergodic Theory, Graduate Texts in
Mathematics, vol 79, Springer-Verlag, 1981.

There will be 8 lectures in all.

 	All  interested  are  Welcome

                                                CHAIRMAN
