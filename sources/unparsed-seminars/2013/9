Title: Comparison of clustering properties of point processes and
applications to random geometric models

Abstract: I shall talk about some some examples, methods, and recent
results involving comparison of clustering properties of point processes.
The basic observation is that void probabilities and
moment measures are two complementary tools for capturing clustering
phenomena in point processes. Various global and local functionals of
random geometric models driven by point processes admit more or less
explicit bounds involving the void
probabilities and moment measures, thus allowing to study the impact of
clustering of the underlying point process. I shall provide examples of
clustered point processes as well as sketch some recent results obtained
using the afore-mentioned comparison tools. These results pertain to
percolation and coverage properties of the Boolean model, the SINR model,
subgraph counts in random geometric graphs, and more generally,
U-statistics of point processes.

Title: Continuous minimax theorems

Abstract: A minimax theorem is a result that gives a characterization of
eigenvalues of compact self adjoint operators on Hilbert spaces. In 1949
Ky Fan characterized sum of first $k$ eigenvalues of an $n \times n$
Hermitian operator on $C^n$. This gave an extremum property of the sum of
the first $k$ eigenvalues for Hermitian transformations without referring
to any eigenvector. Our work grew out of the search for an extension of Ky
Fan's theorem to such a (finite) von-Neumann algebraic setting. We prove a
version of Ky Fan's theorem for a self adjoint element having a non atomic
distribution in a $II_1$ factor, and we also give an alternate proof for
the finite dimensional version of Ky Fan's original theorem.
