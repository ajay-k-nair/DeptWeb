Title: Pricing Defaultable Bonds in a Markov Modulated Market.

Abstract:
 We address the problem of pricing defaultable bonds in a Markov modulated
market. Using Merton's structural approach we show that various types of
defaultable bonds are combination of European type contingent claims.
Thus pricing a defaultable bond is tantamount to pricing a contingent
claim in a Markov modulated market. Since the market is incomplete we use
the method of quadratic hedging and minimal martingale measure to derive
locally risk minimizing derivative prices, hedging strategies and the
corresponding residual risks. The price of defaultable bonds are obtained
as solutions to a system of PDEs with weak coupling subject to
appropriate terminal and boundary conditions. We solve the system of PDEs
numerically and carry out a numerical investigation for the defaultable
bond prices. We compare their credit spreads with some of the existing
models. We observe higher spreads in the Markov modulated market. We show
how business cycles can be easily incorporated in the proposed framework.
We demonstrate the impact on spreads of the inclusion of rare states that
attempt to capture a tight liquidity situation. These states are
characterized by low risk free interest rate, high payout rate and high
volatility.

Title: Random fields on sphere: an application to cosmology

Abstract:
 We shall begin with a brief introduction of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) radiation. Then we shall discuss various analytical
tools (assumptions) entailing the analysis of the CMB data, which
primarily relates to representation of the CMB data as a random field on
a sphere. In order to further perform statistical analysis of such a
random fields, we use the standard harmonic analysis on sphere, and
obtain some distributional identities which can be labeled as "high
frequency CLTs", which in turn can be used for statistical hypothesis
testing of CMB Data.


            ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED,

                                            Department of Mathematics
