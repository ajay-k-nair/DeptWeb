Dear All,
        Prof. David Gabai, Princeton University, will give a series of
Mathematical Panorama lectures. The details are below.
        All are welcome.
                             regards,
                             Siddhartha Gadgil

Dates: Monday June 25, 2012 - Friday June 29, 2012
Time: 2:00 p.m. to 3:30 p.m.
Venue: LH-1, Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Science.
Topic: Recent developments in 3-manifold theory
Abstract:
            The first lecture will be accessible to a general
audience.It will survey many of the spectacular results that have been
obtained in 3-dimensional topology and geometry within the last 10
years.  Lectures 2-5 will focus on the works of Agol, Wise and
Kahn-Markovic that give a proof of the virtual Haken conjecture.
