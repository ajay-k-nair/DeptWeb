          Edge detection and local approximation using spectral data


                                  by

                          Prof. H. N. Mhaskar
            Department of Mathematics, California State University
                          Los Angeles, U.S.A

               on Monday, February 11, 2008 at 04:00 pm
               in the Lecture Hall - 1 , IISc, Bangalore


                               Abstract:


We discuss the question of identifying local features of a function, such
as the discontinuities in its derivatives, membership in local smoothness
classes, etc., given global information about the function in the form of
its Fourier coefficients with respect to an orthonormal system. We present
a unifying theme for some of the recent work on trigonometric and
algebraic polynomial frames on the circle, the unit interval, the
Euclidean sphere, and a smooth manifold in general. Applications include
direction finding in phased array antennas, estimation of the velocity of
the gulf stream, and semi-supervised learning of hand written digits.

                             ALL ARE INVITED
