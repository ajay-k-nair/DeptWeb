                                    Abstract

This short course will be an introduction to some mathematical results on
turbulence. The emphasis will be on some `solvable' statistical theories
(eg. Burgers, Onsager) that have surprisingly rich behavior. Our aim is to
disseminate some highlights of rigorous mathematical results on these
problems without presupposing much background.
