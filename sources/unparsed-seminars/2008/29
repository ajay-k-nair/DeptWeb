Dear All,

    Title: Embedded Contact Homology of Torus Bundles with Hyperbolic
           Monodromy

  Speaker: Dr. Eli Lebow
           NCBS, Bangalore.

  Time and Date:  4 to 5 PM, 4th (Friday) April

    Venue:  LH 1, Math Dept IISc


Abstract:

   Embedded contact homology is an invariant of contact 3-manifolds.
ECH is given by the homology of a chain complex generated by certain
collections of embedded closed Reeb orbits in the 3-manifold Y,
with a differential that counts certain embedded pseudoholomorphic
curves in Y x R.

  The result presented in this talk gives the ECH of T^2 bundles over
S^1 whose monodromy A in SL_2(Z) is a hyperbolic matrix (or $-1$), where these 
manifolds are equipped with certain standard contact forms.
The form of the answer is nearly independent of A, essentially depending
only on whether the eigenvalues are positive or negative.

This work extends the results and methods of Hutchings and Sullivan
(``Rounding corners of polygons and the embedded contact homology
of {$T\sp 3$}'', Geometry and Topology, 2006) on the case Y=T^3.
