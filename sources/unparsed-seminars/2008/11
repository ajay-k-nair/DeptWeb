                                  Abstract
                                 ------------

Abstract. We will discuss two aspects : dynamics of maps and dynamics of
holomorphic foliations. Holomorphic dynamics in several variables has
interractions with ergodic theory, dynamical systems, algebraic geometry
and number theory. It is indeed a special chapter in dynamics, but the
tools from complex analysis and geometry permit to answer questions which
are out of reach in real dynamics. As a sample, we will discuss dynamics
of holomorphic endomorphisms of complex projective spaces, polynomial
automorphisms of Euclidian spaces and more generally dynamics of
meromorphic maps on compact Kahler manifolds. We will consruct in these
cases Green currents, compute the entropy of the maps, introduce the
measure of maximal entropy and develop some precise ergodic theory
(exponential decay of correlation, central limit theorem). We will discuss
equidistribution
problems. Let f be a meromorphic map of a compact Kahler manifold
M. Let S be an analytic set of codimension p in M. The problem is to
describe the distribution of (normalized) preimages of S under the
iterates of f. Even the case of points is subtle. We will treat this
question for holomorphic endomorphisms of Pk and for polynomial
automorphisms of Ck. We will introduce the theory of Super-potentials
which provides a useful calculus on positive closed (p, p) currents for
arbitrary p. It permits to obtain quantitative results on the speed of
equidistribution. The background is described in the notes with T.C Dinh:
Dynamics in Several Complex Variables: endomorphisms of projective spaces
and polynomial like mappings:ArXiv 08100811.v

Dynamics of foliations: We will introduce foliations by Riemann Surfaces
on Projective spaces. The main goal is to prove a unique ergodicity result
for generic holomorphic foliations of P2. This is joint work with J.E
Fornaess. The background is described in the recent survey by the authors
which appeared in the Journal of Geometric Analysis (April 2008).
