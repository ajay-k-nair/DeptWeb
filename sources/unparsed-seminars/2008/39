                               Abstract

The purpose of this series of lectures is to discuss the Greene-Krantz
semi-continuity theorems for automorphism groups and the theorems of
Bedford-Dadok and Saerens-Zame on realizing compact Lie groups as the
automorphism group of bounded strongly pseudoconvex domains. The question
of realizing closed subgroups of the given automorphism group by
perturbation of the boundary of the domain will also be considered.
