Dear All,

   Speaker: Dr. Ameya Pitale,
            University of Oklahoma

   Title : L-functions

   Time and Date: 4 to 5 PM , 8th July (Tuesday)

   Venue: LH-3, Maths Dept, IISc


Abstract : I will try to give a gentle introduction to the theory of 
L-functions starting with the Riemann zeta function. I will explain the
fascinating arithmetic and analytic significance of these L-functions. If 
time permits, I will speak of my current work with Ralf Schmidt on 
L-functions for GSp(4)xGL(2).
