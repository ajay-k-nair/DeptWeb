Title : Completely bounded kernels

Abstract: Given a set $X$ and two $C^*$-algebras $A$ and $B$, a kernel $k$
is defined as a function from $X\times X$ to $L(A, B)$, the bounded linear
maps from $A$ to $B$. The kernel $k$ is positive if for all finite sets $F
= \{(x_j , a_j)\} \subset X \times A$, the matrix \begin{equation*}
(k(x_i, x_j)[a_ia^*_j ])_{F\times F} \qquad\qquad(*)
\end{equation*}
is nonnegative. If the same is true whenever we replace $X\times A$ by
$X\times M_n(A)$ and $k$ by $k\otimes 1_n$ for any $n\in \mathbb N$, then
$k$ is said to be completely positive (the two concepts coincide when $A =
B = \mathbb C$).  Completely positive kernels have several equivalent
characterisations, including the existence of a so-called Kolmogorov
decomposition.  Constantinescu and Gheondea, generalising results of
Laurent Schwartz, considered kernels $k$ where the matrix in ($*$) is
merely selfadjoint with $L(A, B) = B(H)$, $H$ a Hilbert space, and found
necessary and sufficient conditions for the decomposability of such
kernels as the difference of (completely) positive kernels.  A result of
Haagerup implies that when $A$ and $B$ are von Neumann algebras such
decompositions in terms of completely positive kernels will fail if $B$ is
not injective.  In this talk we discuss decomposability of self adjoint
kernels as differences of
completely positive kernels when $A$ and $B$ are $C^*$-algebras,
characterising decomposable kernels.  We also discuss the case when
the matrix in ($*$) is a only a completely bounded map, giving an
analogue of the Wittstock decomposition for such kernels.

This is joint work with Tirtha Bhattacharyya and Chris Todd.
