                                    Abstract

In recent decades the field of processes of anomalous diffusion has won
more and more interest in applications to several fields of sciences, and
even to finance. We will give here some views into this rapidly developing
field, paying attention to some deterministic and stochastic aspects
related to kinetic master equations of fractional order governing these
generalized diffusion processes. Indeed, these equations contain
pseudo-differential operators that can be interpreted as space and/or time
derivatives of non-integer order. In particular, we outline the recent
work carried out by our research group on these topics. For more
information see our WEB site devoted to FRActional CALculus MOdelling:
