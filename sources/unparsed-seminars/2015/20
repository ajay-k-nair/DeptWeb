Dear all, there will be two lectures in the Eigenfunctions seminar on 4th 
Sep, 2015.

Lectue 1:

Speaker: Siegfried Böcherer (Universität Mannheim)

Title: Maximal and extremal lattices

Time and venue: 04 Sep, 2:15 PM, LH-1, Dept of mathematics

Abstract: We consider integral lattices L in an euclidian space V = R^m, 
i.e. Z-submodules of full rank in V such that all vectors in L have 
integral length. It is impossible to classify such lattices up to 
isometry, there are just too many of them in general, even if we ﬁx 
additional invariants such as the discriminant. Therefore one looks for 
interesting subclasses of lattices, in particular “extremal lattices”, 
characterized by the property that the smallest length of a non-zero 
vector in L is "as large as possible". There are several ways to
make this more precise, we will focus on analytic extremality, where modu-
lar forms come in. In particular, we will consider extremality for maximal
lattices.

Lecture 2:

Speaker: Navin Goyal (Microsoft research, Bangalore)

Title: Algorithms for independent component analysis

Time and venue: 04 Sep, 3:30 PM, LH-1, Dept of mathematics

Abstract: Independent component analysis (ICA) is a basic problem that 
arises in several areas including signal processing, statistics, and 
machine learning. In this problem, we are given linear superpositions of 
signals. E.g., we could be receiving signals from several sensors but the 
receivers only get the weighted sums of these signals. The problem is to 
recover the original signals from the superposed data. In some situations 
this turns out to be possible: the main assumption being that the signals 
at different sensors are independent random variables. While independent 
component analysis is a well-studied problem, one version of it was not 
well-understood, namely when the original signals are allowed to be 
heavy-tailed, such as those with a Pareto distribution. Such signals do 
arise in some applications. In this talk, I will first discuss the 
previously known algorithms for ICA and then a new algorithm that applies 
also to for the heavy-tailed case. The techniques used are basic linear 
algebra and probability.
