Title: Risk-Sensitive Ergodic Control of Continuous Time Markov Processes
With Denumerable State Space

Abstract:  We study risk-sensitive control problem with controlled
continuous time Markov chain state dynamics. Using multiplicative dynamic
programming principle, we prove the existence and a characterization of
optimal risk-sensitive control under geometric ergodicity of the state
dynamics along with a smallness condition on the running cost.

Title : Harnack inequality for non-local Schrdinger operators

Abstract :  We show a Harnack inequality for bounded positive solutions of
a non-local Schrodinger operator. This is joint work with Koushik
Ramachandran. http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.07289
