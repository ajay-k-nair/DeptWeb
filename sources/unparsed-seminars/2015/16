Dear All,

    We shall have the third set of lectures for the semester in the
eigenfunctions series. There will be three lectures.

Date: Friday, March 6, 2015.

Time: Lecture I: 2:00 pm. - 2:50 p.m.
      Lecture II: 3:00 p.m. - 3:50 p.m.
      Lecture III: 4:00 - 4:50 p.m

Venue: LH-I, Department of Mathematics, IISc.

Lecture Details:

Lecture 1:
Speaker: Amritanshu Prasad (IMSc, Chennai)
Time: 2.00-2.50 pm

Title: Kronecker Coefficients, Integer Arrays and the RSK Correspondence

Abstract: A Kronecker coefficient counts the number of times a
representation of a symmetric group occurs in the tensor product of two
others. Finding a fast algorithm to determine when a Kronecker coefficient
is positive is an open problem. There has been an increased interest in
this problem over the last few years as it comes up in the geometric
approach to the complexity conjecture P = NP due to Mulmuley and Sohoni. I
will explain how a higher dimensional analogue of the
Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence relates Kronecker coefficients to
the problem of counting the number of integer arrays with specified slice
sums.


Lecture 2
Speaker: Pooja Singla
Time: 3.00-3.50 pm

Title: Generating a random permutation with random transpositions.

Abstract: Consider the problem of n cards labelled 1 through n. Suppose
two integers i and j are chosen independently and uniformly between 1 and
n. The cards labelled i and j are switched. If many such transpositions
are made the row of cards will tend to appear in random arrangement. Then
question is how many steps are required until the deck is well mixed up
(i.e. the permutation is close to random)? Diaconis and Shahshahani used
tools of representation theory of symmetric groups to prove that at least
1/2(n log n) steps are required before the deck will be well mixed up for
large n. I will explain ideas of their proof and few related problems.


Lecture 3
Speaker: Steven Spallone(IISER Pune)
Time: 4.00-4.50 pm

Title: Weyl's Integration Formula for Unitary Groups

Abstract: Weyl discovered a decomposition of the invariant probability
measure on a connected compact Lie group, according to elements of a
maximal torus and their conjugacy classes. In the case of the unitary
group, it allowed Diaconis and Shahshahani to access the distribution of
the eigenvalues of a random unitary matrix. We explore these ideas in the
lecture.
