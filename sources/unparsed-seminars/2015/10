Dear All,

   Title: Compact Khler manifolds with semipositive Ricci curvature and
rational connectedness (joint work with F. Campana and Th. Peternell)

   Speaker: J.-P. Demailly

   Time, Date and Venue:  3.30 -5.00 Tuesday (5th Jan) and Thursday (7th)
    LH 3

   Abstract: The goal of the talks is to describe a structure theorem for
compact Khler manifolds with semipositive anticanonical bundle.
Up to finite tale cover, one shows that such manifolds split
holomorphically and isometrically as a product of Ricci flat varieties
and of rationally connected manifolds.

The proof is based on a characterization of rational connectedness
through the non-existence of certain global twisted contravariant
tensors of the tangent bundle, along with a generalized holonomy
principle for pseudoeffective line bundles - i.e. bundles that have
semipositive curvature in the sense of currents. A crucial ingredient
for this is the characterization of uniruledness by the property that
the anticanonical bundle is not pseudoeffective.

Best Regards
Harish Seshadri
