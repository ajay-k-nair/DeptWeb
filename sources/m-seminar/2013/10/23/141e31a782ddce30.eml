Abstract:
A conjecture of Gelander states that there is an effective
triangulation in a compact deformation retract of a given
locally symmetric space, giving linear bounds on the full
homotopy type. This talk will explain some of this
construction.


                        ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED
