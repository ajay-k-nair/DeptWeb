Dear all,


                           Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                  COLLOQUIUM


Speaker :  Prof Jaydeb Sarkar,
                             ISI Bangalore

Title :        Beurling-Lax-Halmos Theorem and Operator Theory

Date :      25th October, 2013 (Friday)

Time :      3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue :     Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract: This talk will be an elementary introduction to (Hilbert) module
approach to operator theory. We explore the relationship of the classical
von Neumann-Wold decomposition theorem and the Beurling-Lax-Halmos theorem
for isometries. We will also discuss a unified approach to the invariant
subspace problem for bounded linear operators on Hilbert spaces. The talk
will be accessible to general audience including graduate students.


                 ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED



Chairman,
Department of Mathematics.
