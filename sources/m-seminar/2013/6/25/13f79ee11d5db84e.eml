  				SEMINAR


Speaker	: Prof. Siddhartha Gadgil

Title	: Glimpses of HOTT; Logic and Topology make elegant
  	  and useful Foundations

Date	: July 1, 2013

Time	: 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue	: Lecture Hall III, Department of Mathematics


Abstract:

HOTT (homotopy type theory) is logic built on type theory
(mostly from Computer Science) and ideas from topology to give
foundations of mathematics that are very elegant and much closer
to mathematical practice. This makes HOTT very useful for computer
proof systems, and also gives a very nice new synthetic treatment
of homotopy theory.

HOTT was recently developed in a collaborative effort led by
Voevodsky and others and launched into the world in the form of
the (freely available) HOTT book. In this talk I will give a first
exposition of HOTT. I will assume some basic topology, essentially
definitions of homotopy and fundamental groups.
