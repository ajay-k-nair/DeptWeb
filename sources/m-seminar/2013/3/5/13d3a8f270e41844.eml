Dear all,



    IMI COMPACT COURSE CONSISTING OF SIX LECTURES
-------------------------------------------------------------

Speaker: Mokshay Madiman (Yale university)

Title: An exposition of selected tools from additive combinatorics

Venue: LH-1, Department of mathematics.

Date: March 8, 13, 15, 20, 22, 27 [Wed, Fri]

Time: 2:00-3:30 PM

Abstract: Tools from additive combinatorics are finding their way into
numerous areas of mathematics and applied mathematics, and in
particular have been central to recent developments in both random
matrix theory and harmonic analysis. The goal of this short course is
to understand some of these tools. (If time permits and the audience
is willing to pitch in with some talks, we may also cover selected
applications.)

Specifically, we will focus on at least two out of the following three
tools that have now become central in additive combinatorics: the
Balog-Szemeredi-Gowers theorem, the Croot-Sisask theorem, and Freiman's
theorem. A variety of subsidiary tools will be used to obtain these
results--including ideas from probability, combinatorics, and harmonic
analysis.

Just to give some vague motivation, here is a brief description of
Freiman's theorem in the setting of the additive group of the
integers. The Cauchy-Davenport theorem asserts that the sum of two
subsets of the integers (where by sum of A and B, we mean all sums of
form a+b, with a, b elements of A and B respectively) is minimized
given the cardinality of the two subsets when both are arithmetic
progressions. Freiman's theorem describes in what sense a converse of
this result is true-- that is, if we know the size of the "sumset" is
not too large, can we deduce some kind of additive structure for the
underlying sets? It is remarkable because relatively "soft"
information on the cardinalities of the sets involved is used to
deduce "hard" information on the structure of the sets, and
consequently is useful in a number of contexts.

No specialized knowledge will be assumed for these lectures beyond what a
well-rounded mathematics graduate student might be expected to know.
In cases where we might go beyond this, an attempt will be made to
provide a telegraphic summary of necessary material.

          All are cordially invited,


                                                      Chairman,
                                             Department of Mathematics.
