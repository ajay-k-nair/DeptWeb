Title: Real analytic maps and stable Hamiltonian structures

Abstract: We consider a real analytic map f from R^4 to R^2 with a
singularity at 0. One method to investigate the singularity is to work
on its link L. If 0 is an isolated singularity then it is well known
that L is a fibered link in the 3-sphere S^3. This describes
immediately a contact structure on S^3. In this talk we suggest that
even if 0 is not an isolated singularity, we can associate to the
singularity a well-defined stable Hamiltonian structure on S^3,
provided that f describes a Seifert fibration on S^3, L being a
multi-link in this fibration. This condition is satisfied, for
example, when f is complex analytic or f is given as g\bar{h} with g
and h being complex analytic. If the link is already fibered, the
stable Hamiltonian structure is nothing but the contact structure
mentioned above. Our construction is in fact far more general: given a
Seifert multi-link (not necessarily associated to a map from R^4 to
R^2) in a Seifert fibered 3-manifold, we build a well-defined stable
Hamiltonian structure on the 3-manifold.

             All are cordially invited,


                                                      Chairman,
                                             Department of Mathematics.
