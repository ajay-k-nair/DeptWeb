Dear all,

Title: Metric Measure spaces and Random matrices

Date: Tuesday, April 2, 2013.

Time: 11: 30 a.m.

Venue: LH- II, Department of Mathematics


Abstract: The geometry of Metric spaces equipped with a probability measure
is a very dynamic field. One motivation for the study of such spaces is
that they are the natural limits of Riemannian manifolds in many contexts.
           In this talk, I will introduce basic properties of metric
measure spaces and the Gromov-Prohorov distance on them. I will also
discuss joint work with Manjunath Krishnapur in which we show that
independently sampling points according to the given measure gives an
asymptotically bi-Lipschitz  correspondence between Metric measure spaces
and Random matrices. Finally, I will briefly discuss work with Divakaran in
which we study the compactification of the Moduli space of Riemann surfaces
in terms of metric measure spaces.


          All are cordially invited,


                                                      Chairman,
                                             Department of Mathematics.
