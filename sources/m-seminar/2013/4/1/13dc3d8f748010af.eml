Abstract:   In this thesis we investigate single and multi-player stochastic
dynamic optimization problems in both discrete and continuous time. In the
multi-player setup we investigate zero-sum games with both complete and
partial information. We study partially observable stochastic games with
average cost criterion and the state process being discrete time
controlled Markov chain. We establish the existence of the value of the
game and also obtain optimal strategies for both players. We also study a
continuous time zero-sum stochastic game with complete observation. In
this case the state is a pure jump Markov process. We investigate the
finite horizon total cost criterion. We characterise the value function
via appropriate Isaacs equations. This also yields optimal Markov
strategies for both players.

In the single player setup we investigate risk-sensitive control of
continuous time Markov chains. We consider both finite and infinite
horizon problems. For the finite horizon total cost problem and the
infinite horizon discounted cost problem we characterise the value
function as the unique solution of appropriate Hamilton Jacobi Bellman
equations. We also derive optimal Markov controls in both the cases. For
the infinite horizon average cost case we shown the existence of an
optimal stationary control.

Further we introduce a new class of stochastic processes which we call
stochastic processes with ``age-dependent transition rates''. We compute
the limiting probabilities for the process. We then study the controlled
version of the above process. In this case we take the risk-neutral cost
criterion. We solve the infinite horizon discounted cost problem and the
average cost problem. The finite horizon total cost problem is also
investigated.
