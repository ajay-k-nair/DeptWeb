Title: Littlewood-Offord problem

Date: April 5th, 2013(Friday)

Time: 2:00-3:30 PM

Venue: Department of Mathematics, LH-1

Abstract: In the seqries of 4 lectures, we will cover some aspects of the
Littlewood-Offord problem. This problem concerns the anti-concentration
phenomenon of sums of independent random variables and has applications to
invertibility of random matrices and statistics of real zeros of random
polynomials. The subject overlaps probability, combinatorics, additive
combinatorics and some algebra.

First lecture (Fri, 5th Apr): Given n-integers a_1,...,a_n, for each real
number x, let q(x) be the number of subsets of a_1,...,a_n that sum to x.
Let q=sup{q(x) : x real}. We prove two theorems:

1) Littlewood, Offord, Erdos: q is maximized when a_i are all equal.

2) Erdos, Moser,...,Stanley, Proctor: If a_1,...,a_n are distinct, then q
is maximized for the set 1,2,...,n.

If X_i are i.i.d. Ber(1/2) random variables, the above results give upper
bounds on the largest atom of a_1X_1+...+a_nX_n.


          All are cordially invited,


                                                      Chairman,
                                             Department of Mathematics.
