Title   : On some generalizations and applications of Eisenstein-Dumas
             and Schonemann Criteria

Abstract. One of the results generalizing Eisenstein Irreducibility
Criterion states that if $\phi(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + ... + a_0$
is a polynomial with coefficients from the ring of integers such that
$a_s$ is not divisible by a prime p for some $s \leq n$, each $a_i$ is
divisible by p for $0 \leq i \leq s-1$ and $a_0$ is not divisible by $p^2$
then $\phi(x)$ has an irreducible factor of degree at least $s$ over the
field of rational numbers. We have observed that if  \phi(x) is as above,
then it has an irreducible factor g(x) of degree s over the ring of p-adic
integers such that
g(x) is an Eisenstein polynomial with respect to p. In this lecture, we
discuss
an analogue of the above result for a wider class of polynomials which
will extend the classical Schonemann Irreducibility Criterion as well as
Generalized Schonemann Irreducibility Criterion and yields irreducibility
criteria by Akira and Tverberg
(cf. J. Number Theory, 25 (1987) 107-111, Prace Mat., 8 (1964) 117-118).


All are cordially invited!
