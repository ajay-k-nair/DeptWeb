Dear all,


Please see the abstract for Professor Harald Upmeier's lecture series.


Speaker:          Professor Harald Upmeier
                          University of Marburg, Germany

Title:             New directions in complex analysis on symmetric domain

Date & time:      Dec 4, Dec 6, and Dec 9 at 3.30pm, Dec 11 at 2.00pm

Venue:            LH-I, department of Mathematics.

Abstract:
The Lectures will focus on topics that go beyond the classical framework
of   Hilbert spaces of holomorphic functions (Bergman spaces, Hardy
spaces) on the unit ball or more general bounded symmetric domains. The
main point is to include vector-valued functions and even cohomology
classes for non-convex domains. The plan of the lectures is as follows:

1. Irreducible Hilbert spaces of vector-valued holomorphic maps on
symmetric domains, realization of holomorphic discrete series
2. Reducible Hilbert spaces of vector-valued holomorphic maps on symmetric
domains, intertwining operators
3. Cohomology classes and Radon transform on non-convex cones and tube
domains
4. Cohomology classes on flag domains and decomposition of the Shilov
boundary

Concepts from Jordan algebras will be used to present these topics in a
uniform geometric way.

All are cordially invited.

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics.
