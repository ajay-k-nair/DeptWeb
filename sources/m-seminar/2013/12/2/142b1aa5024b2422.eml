Dear all,

                           Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR


Speaker : Prof Todd Quinto
                      Tufts University

Title   : Microlocal Analysis and Tomography

Date    : 12th Dec, 2013 (Thursday)

Time    : 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics


Abstract:
We consider the reconstruction problem for limited angle
tomography using filtered backprojection (FBP).  We introduce
microlocal analysis and use it to explain why the well-known streak
artifacts are present at the end of the limited angular range.  We
explain how to mitigate the streaks and prove that our modified FBP
operator is a standard pseudodifferential operator, and so it does not
add artifacts.  We provide reconstructions to illustrate our
mathematical results.  This is joint work with Juergen Frikel,
Helmholtz Zentrum, Muenchen.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics.
