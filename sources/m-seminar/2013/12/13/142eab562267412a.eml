Abstract: In cooperative game theory ,  Shapley value and the nucleolus
are two fundamental solution concepts.  They associate a unique imputation
for the players  whose coalitional worth s  are  given a priori.

Assignment games are two sided matching games (say between sellers and
buyers) where the coalitional worth between a buyer and seller  is 
specified by an entry of a  nonnegative  matrix .   (Here , the  rows of
the matrix represent sellers and the columns  of the matrix represent
buyers).   ,  For a real estate agent eyeing on commissions from both
sellers and buyers,  any optimal assignment will correspond to the best
possible t deal. The agent  can always initiate an imputation from the
core , via the  dual  optimal solutions.  The algorithm at the end of the
first iteration reaches the unique corner that favors all sellers. 
Nucleolus is invariably a relative interior point of the core and the 
algorithm at each iteration  selects this most favorable  imputation for
all sellers in  a shrinking  family of imputation polyhedra.. Here the
shrinking process correspond to the faces of the polyhedra  moving inside
at varying speeds.  We can associate  with each face of the current
polyhedra  a coalition and the faces that are trying to jam inside with
varying speed , correspond to the  so called unsettled  coalitions that 
clamor for greater satisfaction for its members.   Improvements correspond
to redistributions captured via  squeezing the certain faces of the sub
polyhedra of the imputation set  by applying  different levels of pressure
and reducing the dimension of the current subset of the imputation set.
The algorithm terminates when this squeezing process terminates in a 
single point.   One can associate a graph  with directed arcs
corresponding to unhappy coalitions and the  determination of  applying
such varied pressures is achieved through the length of the longest path
ending at each vertex of an associated graph. The algorithm starts with
just a set of vertices of a graph with no arcs to start with.   In each
intermediate stage,  one introduces directed arcs corresponding to the
equivalence class of unsettled and unhappy coalitions. . When more and
more arcs are introduced,  we reach cycles and the vertices within a  
cycle are identified as equivalent and are shrunk to just  one 
representative vertex.  This way, at the end of each  iteration,  the
number of vertices of the graph are reduced at least by one..  New
directed arcs are introduced in the next iteration and this process
continues till just one vertex survives.   The  algorithm terminates  at
this stage and the associated imputation is the nucleolus.  The algorithm
exploits the special lattice structure of the core for assignment games
and all computations involve only dealing with the small class of buyer
seller pairs.

Many other subclasses of cooperative games like the connected games and
some subclass of permutation games have similar algorithms for locating
the nucleolus.   As locating  the for Shapley value, the problems are wide
open.

All are cordially invited!
