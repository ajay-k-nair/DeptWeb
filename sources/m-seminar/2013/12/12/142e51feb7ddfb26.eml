Dear all,

                           Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : Aniruddha Venkata
          Centre for Excellence in Basic Sciences, Mumbai

Title   : On Frankl's conjecture

Date    : 12th Dec, 2013 (Thursday)

Time    : 2:00 - 3:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall III, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:  A family of sets is said to be union-closed if the union of any
two sets from the family remains in the family. Frankl's conjecture, aka
the union-closed sets conjecture, is the remarkable statement that for any
finite union-closed family of finite sets, there exists an element that
belongs to at least half of the sets in the family. Originally stated in
1979, it is still wide open.
 This will be an informal discussion on progress towards the conjecture.



All are cordially invited!
