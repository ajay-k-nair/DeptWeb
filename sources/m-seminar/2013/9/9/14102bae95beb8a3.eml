Abstract:
We consider non-local currents in the context of quantized affine
algebras. In two special cases, these currents can be identified with
configurations in the six-vertex and Izergin--Korepin nineteen-vertex
models. Mapping these to their corresponding Temperley--Lieb loop models,
we directly identify non-local currents with discretely holomorphic loop
observables. In particular, we show that the bulk discrete holomorphicity
relation and its recently derived boundary analogue are equivalent to
conservation laws for non-local currents. Joint with Y. Ikhlef, R. Weston
and M. Wheeler.

                 ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED



Chairman,
Department of Mathematics.
