Abstract:
Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT), developed recently in a large
collaboration centered at IAS, Princeton, combines elements
from type theory, logic and topology to give alternative foundations
of mathematics which are much closer to mathematical practice (useful
for Automated Reasoning). HoTT also gives new insights into topology.

This lecture will introduce HoTT, especially focused on the interplay
between induction principles and the equality type and concepts from
topology such as $A_\infty$-structures. 

Prerequisite: Some basic topology: definitions and basic properties
of homotopy and fundamental groups.
