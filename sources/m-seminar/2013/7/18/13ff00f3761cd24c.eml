Title   : The Hopf map, higher linking and friends

Time    : 3:00 - 4:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall III, Department of Mathematics


Abstract:
Basic Algebraic Topology is built on considering objects (such
as differential forms) up to boundary (e.g., exterior derivative).
However, there is more structure in chains and boundaries that can be
extracted by not immediately passing to quotients. We will discuss
elementary examples of this, such as the Hopf invariant and Milnor's
higher linking. 
     
Prerequisites: Basics of differential forms (closed and exact forms,
wedge product) and Algebraic Topology (up to homology groups of
spheres)

                       ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED
