Title	: Potential theory on infinite graphs

Date	: July 12, 2013

Time	: 4:00 - 5:00 p.m.

Venue	: Lecture Hall III, Department of Mathematics


Abstract:
The classical (as well as axiomatic) potential theory has been
developed in the context of the study of analytic functions on
Riemann surfaces, Newton potentials and Markov processes. This
talk aims to develop a discrete version of potential theory on
infinite graphs, based on the examples of electrical networks
and infinite graphs.
