The talk on the 12th by Prof. Victor Anandam, entitled "Potential
theory on infinite graphs", belongs to the regular series of Friday
seminars at the Department of Mathematics, IISc, and **not** to
the Geometry/Topology Informal Seminar, as erroneously announced
earlier today.

Speaker	: Prof. Victor Anandam

Title	: Potential theory on infinite graphs

Time	: 4:00 - 5:00 p.m.

Venue	: Lecture Hall III, Department of Mathematics


Abstract:
The classical (as well as axiomatic) potential theory has been
developed in the context of the study of analytic functions on
Riemann surfaces, Newton potentials and Markov processes. This
talk aims to develop a discrete version of potential theory on
infinite graphs, based on the examples of electrical networks
and infinite graphs.
