Title: Moebius and conformal maps between boundaries of CAT(-1) spaces.

Abstract: Motivated by rigidity problems for negatively curved manifolds,
we study Moebius and conformal maps $f : \partial X \to \partial Y$
between boundaries of CAT(-1) spaces $X, Y$ equipped with visual metrics.

We show that if $X,Y$ are proper, geodesically complete CAT(-1) spaces
then any Moebius homeomorphism $f$ extends to a $(1, \log
2)$-quasi-isometry with image $1/2\log 2$-dense in $Y$. We prove that if
$X,Y$ are in addition metric trees then $f$ extends to a surjective
isometry. The proofs involve a study of a space $\mathcal{M}(\partial X)$
of metrics on $\partial X$ Moebius equivalent to a visual metric and a
natural isometric embedding of $X$ into $\mathcal{M}(\partial X)$.
Studying the derivative of this embedding we show that the image of the
embedding is $(1/2)\log 2$-dense.

We also obtain a dynamical classification of Moebius self-maps $f :
\partial X \to \partial X$ into three types, elliptic, parabolic and
hyperbolic.



            ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED,




                                            Chairman,
                                            Department of Mathematics
