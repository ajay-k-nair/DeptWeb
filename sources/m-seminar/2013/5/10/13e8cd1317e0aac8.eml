Dear All,

                        SEMINAR

Speaker:   Prof. Philip Roe
                  University of Michigan

Title:   Geometrical treatment of geometric shock waves

Date:   May 10th, 2013 (Friday)

Time:   4:00 pm- 5:00pm

Venue:   Department of Mathematics, LH-I

 Abstract:-

Geometrical shock dynamics (GSD) models the motion of shockwaves by
appealing, semi-empirically, to the geometry of shock fronts and ray curves,
while giving little or no attention to the post-shock flow. If no such
attention
is made, the derivation is almost purely geometrical (although a function is
needed to link the speed of propagation of the front with the divergence of
the raytubes) and some problems can be solved by simple quadrature. The
majority of problems, however, require some numerical treatment that can
be derived from the handling of more general sets of conservation laws.
Indeed, even the geometric derivation has been abandoned in the cases
of three-dimensional propagation, or propagation into a moving stream.
We observe that these steps are unnecessary, and that they lose both
efficiency and accuracy. Especially the three-dimensional case benefits
greatly from retaining the geometrical viewpoint.

In the second part of the talk, we link the numerical solution of GSD with
two issues of more general interest, namely the solution of conservation
laws under differential constraints, and the solution of hydrodynamic
problems in Lagrangian coordinates. In both instances the GSD problem
emerges as a very simple special case, displays the difficulties in a
particularly transparent form, and suggests effective general procedures.

            ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED,
