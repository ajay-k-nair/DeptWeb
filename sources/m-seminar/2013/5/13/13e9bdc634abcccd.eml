 Abstract:-
A robust, inexpensive, general-purpose CFD algorithm of better than
second-order accuracy would have transformative impact on scientific
computing. This talk will describes progress toward this objective.

“Active flux” schemes are finite-volume schemes in which the interface
fluxes are independent degrees of freedom, rather than being interpolated
from the cell averages. This both doubles the effective resolution of a given
grid, and raises the default order of accuracy from two to three. Such a
scheme was actually proposed by van Leer in 1977, although its merits went
largely unrecognized for many years. We have recently brought this method
to the point of solving both linear advection and linear acoustic problems to
third-order on arbitrary unstructured grids in any number of dimensions.

On simplicial grids, a conservative mean value is stored for each cell and
non-conservative degrees of freedom are held to reside at cell vertices and
edge mid-points, allowing a local quadratic reconstruction that is
independent of neighboring cells. This reconstruction defines the
contribution that this cell makes to the update of each such degree of
freedom. In the case of advection, this contribution is defined by
interpolation
within the cell determined by the backward-drawn characteristic. In the case
of an acoustic problem, this update is obtained from the method of
spherical means, which is a truly multidimensional method of upwinding.
The cell average can now be obtained by integrating around
the boundary, which gains one order of accuracy over that of the
reconstruction. The linear Euler equations can be solved by
operator-splitting
without loss of accuracy. Current effort is focused on nonlinear aspects
including
limiting. We also give preliminary results from a fifth-order scheme.

            ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED,
