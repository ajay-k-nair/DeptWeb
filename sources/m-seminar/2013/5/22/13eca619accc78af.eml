Dear All,




                       Department of Mathematics
                Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                        SEMINAR


Speaker: Prof. Johnny Guzman
         Division of Applied Mathematics,
         Borwn University, Providence.

Title: Preserving physical quantities of interest in finite elements with
rational bubbles

Date: May 22nd, 2013 (Wednesday)

Time: 4.00pm - 5.00pm

Venue: Department of Mathematics, LH-1


Abstract: Many commonly used mixed finite elements for the Stokes problem
only conserve mass approximately. We show that if we supplement polynomial
basis functions with divergence free rational functions in the finite
element method we can conserve mass exactly. Similarly, we show how to
supplement polynomial basis in the finite element space with rational
functions in  when approximating linear elasticity problems in order to
preserve angular momentum exactly. This is joint work with Michael Neilan
(University of Pittsburgh).


            ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED,




                                            Chairman,
