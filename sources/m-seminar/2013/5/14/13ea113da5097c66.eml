Dear All,

                Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                        Lecture Series

Speaker:   Jaikrishanan Janardhanan
                  Indian Institute of Science

Title:   Proper holomorphic mappings between bounded symmetric domains

Venue:   Department of Mathematics, LH-I

First lecture:  May 15th, 2013 (Wednesday)

Time: 2.30pm - 4.00 pm

Abstract:

We prove that a proper holomorphic map between two bounded symmetric
domains of the
same dimension, one of them being irreducible, is a biholomorphism. Our
methods allow us
to give a single, all-encompassing argument that unifies the various
special cases in which
this result is known.  The lectures will be self-contained modulo the
basics of Several Complex Variables.

       All are cordially invited,


                                  Chairman,
                                Department of Mathematics
