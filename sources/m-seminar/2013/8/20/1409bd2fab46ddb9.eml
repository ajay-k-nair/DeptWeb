Abstract:
Around 1960, Grothendieck developed the theory of descent. The aim of
this theory is to construct geometric objects on a base space -- in
particular bundles, sheaves and their sections -- in terms a generalized
covering space which is visualized to lie `upstairs' over the base space.
The objects over the base space are obtained by `descending' similar
objects from the covering space.
    In late 1960s-early 1970s, Deligne addressed the problem of how to
understand cohomology of the base space via cohomology of a covering, by
this time descending cohomology classes (instead of just descending global
sections of sheaves, which is the case of 0th cohomology). The theory
developed by Deligne, known as `Cohomological Descent' has found important
applications to Hodge theory and to cohomology of algebraic stacks.
    In these two expository lectures, I will begin with a quick look at
Grothendieck's theory of descent, and then go on to give a brief
introduction to Deligne's theory of Cohomological Descent."
