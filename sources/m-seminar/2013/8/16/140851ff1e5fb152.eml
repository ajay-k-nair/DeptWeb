Dear all,



                           Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                  SEMINAR


Speaker : Dr. Vijay Kumar Sohani
                    IISc, Bangalore

Title: Nonlinear Schrodinger equation and the twisted Laplacian

Date    : August 16, 2013 (Friday)

Time    : 4:00 - 5:00 p.m.

Venue  : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics


Abstract:
In this lecture we will study the well posedness problem for the nonlinear
Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the magnetic Laplacian on $\R^{2n}$,
corresponding to constant magnetic field, namely the twisted Laplacian on
$\C^n$.
We establish the well posednes in certain first order Sobolev spaces
associated
to the twisted Laplacian, and also in $L^2(\C^n)$.


The approach is via the spectral theory of the Schr\"{o}dinger propagator
for the twisted Laplacian, and local existence is proved using Strichartz
estimates established for the same.



                      ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED
