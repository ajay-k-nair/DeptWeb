Title:   Projective Normality of G.I.T. quotient varieties modulo finite
          solvable groups and Weyl groups

Date    : August 21, 2013 (Wednesday)

Time    : 3:00 - 4:00 p.m.

Venue  : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
We prove that for any finite dimensional vector space $V$ over an
algebraically closed field $K$, and for any finite subgroup $G$ of $GL(V)$
which is either solvable or is generated by pseudo reflections such that the
$|G|$ is a unit in $K$, the projective variety $P(V)/G$ is projectively
normal
with respect to the descent of $\mathcal O(1)^{\otimes |G|}$, where
$\mathcal O(1)$
denotes the ample generator of the Picard group of $\mathbb P(V)$. We also
prove that for the standard representation $V$ of the Weyl group $W$ of a
semi-simple algebraic group of type $A_n , B_n , C_n , D_n , F_4$ and $G_2$
over $\mathbb C$, the projective variety $\mathbb P(V^m)/W$ is projectively
normal with respect to the descent of $\mathcal O(1)^{\otimes |W|}$, where
$V^m$
denote the direct sum of $m$ copies of $V$.

                      ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED
