Dear All,



                       Department of Mathematics
                Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                         COLLOQUIUM


Speaker : Prof Malabika Pramanik
                           UBC, Canada

Title  : Needles, bushes, hairbrushes and polynomials

Date  : August 14th, 2013(Wednesday)

Time  : 4:00 - 5:00 p.m.

Venue : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics


Abstract:  Points, lines and circles are among the most primitive and
fundamental of mathematical concepts, yet few geometric objects have
generated more beautiful and nontrivial mathematics. Deceptively simple in
their formulation, many classical problems involving sets of lines or
circles remain open to this day. I will begin with a sample that has
spearheaded much of modern research, and explore connections with
analysis, geometry, combinatorics - maybe also parallel parking.


                      ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED


                                                      Chairman,
                                                Department of Mathematics
