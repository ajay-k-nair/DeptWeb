Title   :  Admission Prices and Welfare in Queues

Abstract:  A multiqueue system serves a multiclass population. Classes
differ in
their valuation of time. Oblivious routing  in which routing is not
informed by current queue status or past decisions is assumed. First, we
explore the structure of the routing fractions that maximise social
welfare. We then analyse the case customer are strategic and the queues
have an admission price. We then argue that admission prices can be set to
achieve optimal routing.

A second system will also be briefly described. Here there are two queues:
a FIFO queue and a bidding queue in which customers bid for priority.
Priorities are increasing in the order of the bids.  The equilibrium
behaviour of this system is also presented.

Joint work with Tejas Bodas, A Ganesh and Murtuza Ali Abidin.
