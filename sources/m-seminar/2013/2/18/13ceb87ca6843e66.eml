Dear all,

Kindly note the changes in the following.

                    Department of Mathematics
                       Indian Institute of Science
                                 Bangalore
                    ------------------------

Prof Ritabrata Munshi from TIFR, Mumbai will give a
series of lecture on "Maass forms with a focus on the
conjectures of Ramanujan and Selberg".

Schedule for the lectures:

Feb  18th, 20th and 22nd, 2013 (Mon, Wed and Fri)   4-5pm
in LH-1, Department of mathematics.

Feb  19th(Tue) 10:30-11:30am
in LH-111, Department of mathematics.

Feb 21st(Thu) 4.00-5.00pm
in LH-II, Department of Mathematics


Abstract:
This series of lectures will be on Automorphic forms for discrete
subgroups of SL(2,R). We will start with a quick overview of the
classical modular forms, and then slowly move  on to Maass
forms. Among other things we will cover the theory of Hecke
operators, Fourier coefficients of the Hecke eigenforms,
Spectral theory of the Laplacian, and the Trace formula.
The main focus will be on the conjecture of Ramanujan regarding
the size of Fourier coefficients and the (related) conjecture of
Selberg on the smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian.

              All are cordially invited,


                                                      Chairman,
                                             Department of Mathematics.
