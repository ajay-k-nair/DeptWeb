Dear All,

              Seminar Announcement

Title: Surface diagrams and 4-manifolds (following Jonathan Williams)

Speaker: Siddhartha Gadgil

Date: Tuesday, 12th February 2013

Time: 11:15 a.m.

Venue: LH-III, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
     I will describe work of Jonathan Williams giving a description of
smooth 4-manifolds in terms of certain collections of closed curves on
surfaces and certain moves on them. This builds on constructions using
Lefschetz pencils and their variants, but is a completely elementary
description.
