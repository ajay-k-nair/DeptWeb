Title: Geometrical shock dynamics and Shock vortex interaction

Recent investigations of shock boundary layer interaction reveal that the
reflected shock is being subjected to perturbations from the turbulent
boundary layer and is prone to oscillations. To study the shock oscillations,
we propose to examine the propagation of disturbances along a stationary
oblique shock upon interaction with a two-dimensional vortex. We study the
decay of disturbances along a normal shock upon its interaction with a vortex
as measured from the Euler computations. We use the theory of Geometrical
shock dynamics (GSD) which is a semi empirical theory that predicts the
behavior of shock propagation into a stationary medium, to study the long
range effects. With a required reformulated version of GSD, we study the
shock-vortex interaction problem especially to observe the long range effects
of the disturbances that propagate along the shock. Qualitative comparison
between GSD and Euler computations has been made. The wave structure of
the disturbance resembles two different types of N waves, the decay of which
follows a power law profile. A preliminary extension of GSD to look for
disturbances along shock surfaces in 3-D flows has been formulated.

          All are cordially invited,


                                                      Chairman,
                                             Department of Mathematics.
