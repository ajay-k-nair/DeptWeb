Title: On condition numbers of a basis

Abstract. We define two condition numbers of a basis of a finite di-
mensional normed space in terms of the norms of the basis elements
and the distances of the basis elements from their complementary sub-
spaces. If a condition number of a basis is small, then we would avoid
overflow/underflow in computations as well as `near linear dependence'
of the basis elements. Optimal scaling strategies for reducing the size
of condition numbers of a basis are determined. Condition numbers of
a basis of an inner product space can be calculated explicitly in terms
of the diagonal entries of the corresponding Gram matrix and of its
inverse. We give estimates for the change in condition numbers when
a given basis is transformed by a nonsingular matrix to another basis.
Our condition numbers arise naturally when we consider the problem of
computing the dual basis.
