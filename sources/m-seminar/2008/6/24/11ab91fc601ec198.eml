Venue: LH 1, Mathematics Department

Title: The Gorenstein Colength of an Artinian Local Ring

Abstract:

The question we are interested in is the following: Given an Artinian local 
ring, how 'close' can we get to it by an Artinian Gorenstein local ring. In 
this talk I will make the notion of being 'close' precise numerically. We will 
exhibit some natural bounds on this number and discuss some (old and new) 
results. In particular, if R is a quotient of a power series ring over a field 
of characteristic zero by a power of the maximal ideal, we will see how one can 
compute this number.

Best Regards
Ravindra
