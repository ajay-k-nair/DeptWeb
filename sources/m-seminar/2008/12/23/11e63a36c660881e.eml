Abstract:
     The talk will be a report on an ongoing research
project (joint with Preena Samuel and K.V.Subrahmanyam).
Representation theoretic consequences will be worked out
of the combinatorial characterizations of left, right,
and two-sided Kazhdan-Lusztig cells of the symmetric group.
Applications to invariant theory and both ordinary and
modular representation theory of the symmetric group will
be given.
