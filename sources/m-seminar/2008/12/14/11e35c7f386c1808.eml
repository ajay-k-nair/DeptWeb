Abstract:
     We study families of infinite-dimensional algebras that are similar to
semisimple Lie algebras as well as symplectic reflection algebras.
Infinitesimal Hecke algebras are deformations of semidirect product Lie
algebras, and we study two families over sl(2) and gl(2). Both of them
have a triangular decomposition and a nontrivial center, which allows us
to define and study the BGG Category O over them - including a (central
character) block decomposition, and an analog of Duflo's Theorem about
primitive ideals. We then discuss certain related setups.

 We conclude with the undeformed case of semidirect product Lie
 algebras, and of graded modules over them; this is motivated by the
study of Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules, using truncated current Lie
algebras.
