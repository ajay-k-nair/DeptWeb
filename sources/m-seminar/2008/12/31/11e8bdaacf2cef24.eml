                                  Abstract

Information about available software to solve a large variety of
optimization problems is provided at plato.asu.edu/guide.html while some
of this software is evaluated at plato.asu.edu/bench.html. Starting with
these sources an overview will be given on codes that are particularly
useful for applications in mathematical finance.
