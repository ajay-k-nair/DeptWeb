Abstract:
We investigate the (in)-consistency of different bootstrap methods for
constructing confidence intervals in the class of estimators that converge
at rate $n^{1\over 3}$. The Grenander estimator, the nonparametric maximum
likelihood estimator of an unknown non-increasing density function $f$ on
$[0,\infty)$, is a prototypical example. We focus on this example and
explore different approaches to constructing bootstrap confidence
intervals for $f(t_0)$, where $t_0 \in (0,\infty)$ is an interior point.
We find that the bootstrap estimate, when generating bootstrap samples
from the empirical distribution function or its least concave majorant,
does not have any weak limit in probability. Bootstrapping from a smoothed
version of the least concave majorant, however,  leads to strongly
consistent estimators and the $m$ out of $n$ bootstrap method is also
consistent. Our results cast
serious doubt on some previous claims about bootstrap consistency (in the
class of cube root problems) in the published literature.

This is joint work with Bodhisattva Sen and Michael Woodroofe.
