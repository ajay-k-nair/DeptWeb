Abstract:
In this talk, I will discuss threshold estimation for a regression
function in some different settings. The threshold can either be a
change--point, i.e. a point of jump discontinuity in an otherwise smooth
curve, or the first time that a regression function crosses a certain
level. Both problems have numerous applications in a variety of spheres,
like biology (pharmacology, dose-response experiments) and engineering.
Our goal is to estimate thresholds of this type given a fixed budget of
points to sample from, but with the flexibility that batch sampling can be
done in several stages, so that adaptive strategies are possible. Our
strategy is to use multistage "zoom-in" procedures to estimate the
threshold: an initial fraction of the sample is invested top come up with
a first guess, an adequate neighborhood of the first guess is chosen, more
points
are sampled from this neighborhood and the initial estimate id updated. The
procedure continues thus, ending in a finite number of stages. Such zoom-in
procedures result in accelerated convergence rates over any one--stage
method. Approximations to relative efficiencies are computed and optimal
allocation strategies, as well as recipes for construction of confidence
sets discussed.

This is joint work with George Michailidis, Yan Lan and Runlong Tang.
