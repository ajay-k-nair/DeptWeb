    Day & Date           : Monday, August 25, 2008

Abstract:
   I will outline an approach to noncommutative geometry, due largely to
M. Kontsevich, where certain A-infinity categories play the role of
spaces. This noncommutative geometry program draws much of its
inspiration from homological mirror symmetry. The talk will be purely
expository: it will not contain any new results.
