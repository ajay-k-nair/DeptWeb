Title:               3-D Kinematical Conservation Laws: equations of
evolution of a surface

Day, Date & Time :       Friday, 22nd February, 2008 at 4:00 PM

Venue:         Lecture Hall 3, Department of Mathematics

Abstract
We discuss various proprties of the KCL of Giles, Prasad
and Ravindran (GPR) (1995) in 3-space dimensions. These equations
of evolution of a {\bf propagating} surface $\Omega_t$, are
derived assuming the motion of the surface to be isotropic. These
are the most general equations in conservation form, governing the
evolution of $\Omega_t$ with singularities which we call {\bf
kinks} and which are curves across which the normal $\mathbf{n}$
to $\Omega_t$ and amplitude $w$ on $\Omega_t$ are discontinuous.
We derive a simpler system of six differential equations from KCL
and show that the KCL system is equivalent to the ray equations
for $\Omega_t$. The six independent equations and an energy
transport equation involving $w$ (which is related to the normal
velocity $m$ of $\Omega_t$) form a completely determined system
of seven equations. We have determined eigenvalues of the system
by a very novel method and find that the system has two distinct
nonzero eigenvalues and five zero eigenvalues and the dimension
of the eigenspace associated with the multiple eigenvalue $0$ is
only $4$. For an appropriately defined $m$, the two nonzero
eigenvalues are real when $m>1$ and pure imaginary when $m<1$.
Finally we have shown how to use the theory to concrete examples.
