On the existence and uniqueness of non-Newtonian shear dependent flow in
compliant vessel

Abstract 2
We show the generalization of previous existence and uniqueness result for
Navier-Stokes equation in time-dependent domain, based on energy method
and global iterative approach for decoupling the flow and deformation
problem. We consider here the power law viscosity model describing
shear-dependent non-Newtonian fluids. We explain new techniques for
additional non-linear viscous term, based on monotonous behaviour of
corresponding viscous operator. After proving the existence of weak
solution on a domain with known deformation &#951;=3D &#951;k, the
convergence of iterative process with respect to the domain deformation
can be shown for a special case of coefficients in the deformation
equation.
