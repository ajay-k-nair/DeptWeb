Abstract:
       The existing graph invariants can retrieve certain structural
informations, but they are not sufficient to capture all qualitative
aspects of a graph. One of the aim of graph theory to identify on one hand
the unique and special feature for the network from a particular class and
on the other hand the universal qualities that are shared by other network
structures. It is a challenge to specify the domain of a given a network
structure, on the basis of certain unique qualitative features.
       We develop theoretical scheme and apply the general method, based
on the spectral plot of the normalized graph Laplacian, that is easily
visually analyzed and can be considered as excellent diagnostic to
categorize the networks from different sources. Construction with
different graph operation related to evolution of a network produce
specific eigenvalue, describe certain processes of graph formation that
leave characteristic traces in the spectrum. We show how useful plausible
hypothesis about evolutionary process can be made by investigating the
spectra of a graph constructed from actual data. Based on this idea we
have reconstructed protein-protein interaction network which is
structurally more close to real protein-protein interaction networks than
the networks constructed by other models.
       We also introduced a tentative classification scheme for empirical
networks based on global qualitative properties detected through the
spectrum of the Laplacian of the graph underlying the network.This method
identifies several distinct types of networks across different domains of
applications, which is rather difficult by other existing tool and
parameters. Thus we infer that spectral distribution is complete
qualitative characterization of a graph.
