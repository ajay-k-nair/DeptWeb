Abstract:
 	In the standard stochastic geometric setting, wireless networks 
can be modeled as point processes and their performances as certain mean 
functionals of the point process. Obtaining closed form expressions of 
such functionals is not easy for a general class of point processes. This 
motivates a comparative study. We study comparison of one such class of 
mean functionals - the additive and extremal shot-noise fields - which 
arise naturally in modeling of wireless networks, as ingredients of the so 
called Signal-to-Interference-Noise-Ratio.

To analyze them more rigorously, we make a comparative study of similar 
point processes (i.e, point processes with same number of points on a 
average but differing variances). More generally, we formulate a notion of 
comparison of random measures (measure-valued random variables) with point 
processes being nothing but random counting measures. Extensively using 
the theory of stochastic ordering, we show implications of this comparison 
on attraction or repulsion of points, shot-noise fields etc. The 
interesting examples are the ones that enable comparison of a clustered 
point processes with a homogeneous point process. Such examples shall be 
discussed.  This is an on-going joint work with Francois Baccelli and 
Bartek Blaszczyszyn.

                      All  interested  are  Welcome

                                                     CHAIRMAN
