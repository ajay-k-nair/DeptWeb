Abstract:
 	The existing graph invariants can retrieve certain structural 
informations, but they are not sufficient to capture all qualitative 
aspects of a graph. One of the aim of graph theory to identify on one hand 
the unique and special feature for the network from a particular class and 
on the other hand the universal qualities that are shared by other network 
structures. It is a challenge to specify the domain of a given a network 
structure, on the basis of certain unique qualitative features.
 	We develop theoretical scheme and apply the general method, based 
on the spectral plot of the normalized graph Laplacian, that is easily 
visually analyzed and can be considered as excellent diagnostic to 
categorize the networks from different sources. Construction with 
different graph operation related to evolution of a network produce 
specific eigenvalue, describe certain processes of graph formation that 
leave characteristic traces in the spectrum. We show how useful plausible 
hypothesis about evolutionary process can be made by investigating the 
spectra of a graph constructed from actual data. Based on this idea we 
have reconstructed protein-protein interaction network which is 
structurally more close to real protein-protein interaction networks than 
the networks constructed by other models.
 	We also introduced a tentative classification scheme for empirical 
networks based on global qualitative properties detected through the 
spectrum of the Laplacian of the graph underlying the network.This method 
identifies several distinct types of networks across different domains of 
applications, which is rather difficult by other existing tool and 
parameters. Thus we infer that spectral distribution is complete 
qualitative characterization of a graph.
