Abstract:
 	Yang-Mills gauge theory, classical as well as quantum, in two 
dimensions is both mathematically tractable and poses interesting 
questions. The quantum theory for the field has a mathematically precise 
formulation in terms of a Gaussian measure. Classical holonomies become 
group-valued random variables in this setting.
 	This talk will present an overview of some mathematical problems, 
solutions, and ideas arising from two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory

                      All  interested  are  Welcome

                                                     CHAIRMAN
