Abstract:
         This is an expository talk whose aim will be to give an
introduction to SLE (Schramm-Loewner evolution), discovered by Oded
Schramm in 2000 to describe many critical statistical mechanical systems.

We start by recalling classical facts concerning convergence of random
walk on Z^2 to Brownian motion, and the conformal invariance property of
planar Brownian motion. Then we introduce another model of random paths in
Z^2, known as the self-avoiding random walk and ask the question (open for
fifty years!) of existence of a continuous scaling limit. We use this
discrete model to motivate what is called 'conformal markov property'.
Then we show how Schramm magically used  Loewner's differential equation
(1923) for conformal maps of slit domains to classify all possible scaling
limits satisfying the conformal markov property into a one-parameter
family of random continuous paths! If time permits we shall see some more
discrete models whose limits are SLE.

The talk is meant to be understandable to a general mathematical audience
(a knowledge of Riemann mapping theorem and the idea of Brownian motion is
helpful).
