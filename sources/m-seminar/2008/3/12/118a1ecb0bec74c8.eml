                               Abstract

The statistical study of turbulence is primarily interested in space and
time averages formed in many different ways. A dynamical study would be
interested not just in averages but also in the way in which the whole
velocity field thought of as a point in phase space, evolves over time.
The dynamical point of view is natural in some instances as evidenced by
certain striking coherent structures in the near-wall region of turbulent
shear flows that were first detected in the 1960s. Although understanding
the dynamics of transition and turbulence appear to be very difficult
problems, it appears as if a little light on that problem may have been
shed by some computations and experiments carried out in the last ten
years or so.

These lectures will provide an introduction to the dynamical study of
transition and turbulence. We will show how to reformulate the
Navier-Stokes equation for channels and pipes to get rid of pressure so
that the equation becomes a dynamical system. From that reformulation, we
will derive numerical methods for computing periodic solutions, relative
periodic solutions, steady solutions, and traveling waves. Some of the
periodic solutions reproduce the breakup and re-formation of streaks
observed in the near-wall region. Both recent experiments and computations
suggest that lower-branch traveling waves could be important to transition
to turbulence. That connection, along with other related developments,
will be clarified and explained.
