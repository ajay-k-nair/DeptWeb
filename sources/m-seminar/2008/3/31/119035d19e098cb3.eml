Dear All,


     Title: The Behavior of the Mordell-Weil Groups for an Elliptic Curve.

     Speaker:  Prof. Ralph Greenberg
               University of Washington

     Time and Date:  4 to 5 PM , 3rd April (Thursday)

          Venue: LH 1 Department of Mathematics IISc


Abstract:  The set of points on an elliptic curve with coordinates in a
given field K can be naturally made into an abelian group.  The structure
of this group varies considerably as the field K is allowed to vary.
Nevertheless there is some degree of regularity to this behavior,
partly proven, but mostly conjectural. We will describe what we know about
this topic.
