Title: “On commutators of singular integral operators with BMO functions”

Abstract : Commutators of singular integral operators with BMO functions
were introduced in the seventies by Coifman-Rochberg and Weiss. These
operators are very interesting for many reasons, one of them being the
fact that they are more singular than Calder &#769;on-Zygmundm operators.
In this lecture we plan to give several reasons showing the ”bad” behavior
of these operators.
