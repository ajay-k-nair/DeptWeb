Title: A result for boolean interval of finite groups

Abstract:

A group is cyclic iff its subgroup lattice is distributive. Ore's
generalized one direction of this result. We will discuss a dual version
of Ore's result, for any boolean interval of finite groups under the
assumption that the dual Euler totient of the interval is nonzero. We
conjecture that the dual Euler totient is always nonzero for boolean
intervals. We will discuss some techniques which may be helpful in proving
it. We first see that dual Euler totient of an interval of finite groups
is the Mobius invariant (upto a sign) of its coset poset P. Next in the
boolean group complemented case, we prove that P is Cohen-Macaulay, using
the existence of an explicit EL-labeling. We then see that nontrivial
betti number of the order complex is nonzero, and so is the dual Euler
totient.
