Dear All,

There will be two lectures in the "Eigenfunctions" seminar series this
Friday (17th March).

--------------------------------------------
Lecture 1:

Title: The zoo of Lyapunov vectors and nonlinear filters

Speaker : Amit Apte (ICTS)

Time and date: 2:15-3:15 PM, 17th March

Venue: LH-1, Department of Mathematics

Abstract :  I will introduce the concepts of backward, forward, and
covariant Lyapunov vectors (that are basically "eigenfunctions" of certain
operators) for a dynamical system and discuss their relevance in studying
various stability results, both for the system itself and for nonlinear
filtering problem, which will also be introduced along the way. The
"relevance" to nonlinear filters is in the form of open questions whose
answers (as a set of conjectures) may be gleaned from numerical results
and linear filtering theory.

--------------------------------------------
Lecture 2:

Title: Topology of random points

Speaker: Yogeshwaran. D. (ISI Bangalore)

Time and date: 3:30-4:30 PM, 17th March

Venue: LH-1, Department of Mathematics

Abstract: Given n random points on a manifold embedded in a Euclidean
space, we wish to understand what topological features of the manifold can
be inferred from the geometry of these points. One procedure is to
consider union of Euclidean balls of radius r around the points and study
the topology of this random set (i.e., the union of balls). A more robust
method (known as persistent homology) of inferring the topology of the
underlying manifold is to study the evolution of topology of the random
set as r varies. What topological information (For eg., Betti numbers and
some generalizations) about the underlying manifold can we glean for
different choices of r ?  This question along with some partial answers in
the recent years will be the focus of the talk. I shall try to keep the
talk mostly self-contained assuming only knowledge of basic probability
and point-set topology.
