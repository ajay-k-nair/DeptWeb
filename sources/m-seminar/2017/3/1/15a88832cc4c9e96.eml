       Hi Everyone,

       The next Dynamics Fridays talk will be by Anjali Jaiman, NCBS, on
       "Algorithmic Biosynthesis: Problems and Ideas for Assembling Branched Structures." Abstract is appended at the end of this email.

       Venue: ICTS, Emmy Noether Room
       Date: Friday 03 Mar, 2017,
       Time: 3:00pm

       All are welcome!
       Best,
       Amit Apte, Shashi Thutupalli, Sandeep Krishna

       ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
       p.s. about the series:

       **dynamics fridays** -- a seminar series about complex systems, dynamical systems, and computer science approaches to various problems, particularly in
       biology and physics.

       the format: informal, (preferably) chalk board talks with the aim of stimulating discussion. new results and ideas rather than completed projects / polished
       presentations are particularly encouraged. talks are about an hour long.

       when is it: fridays at 15:00 (once every 4 weeks)

       where is it: alternating between ncbs (ground floor of simons centre) and icts (usually emmy noether room).

       for calendar see: https://theory.ncbs.res.in/dynamics-fridays

       Title and abstract for the talk on Friday 3rd, 3:00pm, by Anjali Jaiman, NCBS.

Title: Algorithmic Biosynthesis: Problems and Ideas for Assembling Branched Structures

Abstract: I will give an overview of what I know about glycosylation, the post-translational addition of branched oligosaccharides to a secreted or transmembrane
protein. Many glycans seem to be Â encode information about a cell-type and cell state, and so reproducible synthesis of individual glycans or sets of glycans
appears to be important, with many disease (genetic, infectious and cancerous) symptoms caused by misexpressed glycans. Cells and organisms do not produce a single
structure, but a stereotyped subset of structures. I will discuss why this is an interesting assembly problem, and what the difficulties are in generating such
structure assemblies. Then I will discuss some ways to think about designing algorithms to general these kinds of assemblies.
