Title : Davenport constant and an external problem related to it

Abstract : For a finite abelian group G with |G| = n, the Davenport
Constant DA(G) is defined to be the least integer k such that any sequence
S with length k of elements in G has a non-empty A weighted zero-sum
subsequence. For certain sets A, we already know the precise value of
constant corresponding to the cyclic group Zn. But for different group G
and A, the precise value of it is still an open question. We try to find
out bounds for these combinatorial invariant for random set A. We got few
results in this connection. In this talk I would like to present those
results and discuss about an extremal problem related to this
combinatorial invariant.
