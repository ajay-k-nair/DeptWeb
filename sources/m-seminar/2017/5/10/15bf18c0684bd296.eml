Title : Explaining the Earth’s surface observations: a Computational
Geodynamics Approach

Abstract: The field of geodynamics deals with the large scale forces
shaping the Earth. Computational geodynamics, which uses numerical
modeling, is one of the most important tools to understand the mechanisms
within the deep Earth. With the help of these numerical models we can
address some of the outstanding questions regarding the processes
operating within the Earth's interior and their control on shaping the
surface of the planet. Much of Earth’s surface observations such as
gravity anomalies, plate motions, dynamic topography, lithosphere stress
field, owe their origin to convection within the Earth’s mantle. While we
understand the basic nature of such flow in the mantle, a lot remains
unexplained, including the complex rheology of the deep mantle and how
this density driven convective flow couples with the shallow surface. In
this talk I will discuss how my group is using numerical modeling to
understand the influence of the deep mantle on surface observations.
