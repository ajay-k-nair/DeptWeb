Dear All,

     Here is a small addendum to Subhojoy's email -

1) I shall be giving a talk on Monday's meeting (Feb 6) on the proof of the
uniformisation theorem for compact Riemann surfaces. (A PDE proof if you
will.)

2) We shall try to keep the seminar as accessible as possible. Of course, a
first course on differential geometry and complex analysis is necessary. It
is meant to cater to students, postdocs, and interested faculty. So we
shall be a little condescending whilst giving talks (at least that is the
plan). As we go along, we shall need some analysis. But the hope is to make
everything self-contained, i.e., nothing beyond complex analysis, and basic
Riemannian geometry shall be assumed.

3) If you have friends (or even better, enemies) in ICTS, ISI, or TIFR-CAM,
please let them know. The more victims, the happier the serial killer.

4) As Subhojoy mentioned, feel free to volunteer to give talks.

Best,
Vamsi
