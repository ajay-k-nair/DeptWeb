Title: Flow Invariance Preserving Feedback Controllers for Sabra Shell
Model of Turbulence

Abstract:

In this talk, I would continue dealing with Sabra shell model of
Turbulence and study one of the important questions for fluid flow
problems namely, finding controls which are capable of preserving the
invariant quantities of the flow.   Controls are designed in the feedback
form such that resultant controlled flow will preserve certain physical
properties of the state such as enstrophy, helicity. We use the theory of
nonlinear semigroups and represent the feedback control as a multi-valued
feedback term which lies in the normal cone of the convex constraint space
under consideration.
