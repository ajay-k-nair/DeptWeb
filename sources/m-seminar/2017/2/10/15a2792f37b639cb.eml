Dear All,

There will be two lectures in the "Eigenfunctions" seminar series on 17th
Feb, 2017.

Lecture 1:

Title: Punctual gluing of t-structures in algebraic geometry

Speaker: Vaibhav Vaish (ISI Bangalore)

Time and date: 2:15-3:15 PM, 17th Feb

Venue: LH-1, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:  The formalism of an "abelian category'' is meant to axiomatize
the operations of linear algebra. From there, the notion of "derived
category'' as the category of complexes "upto quasi-isomorphisms'' is
natural, motivated in part by topology. The formalism of t-structures
allows one to construct new abelian categories which are quite useful in
practice (giving rise to new cohomology theories like intersection
cohomology, for example). In this talk we want to discuss a notion of
punctual (="point-wise'') gluing of t-structures which is possible in the
context of algebraic geometry. The essence of the construction is
classical and well known, but the new language leads to useful
constructions in the motivic world.

Lecture 2:

Title: Graph Partitioning using its Spectra

Speaker: Anand Louis (IISc)

Time and date: 3:30-4:30 PM, 17th Feb

Venue: LH-1, Department of Mathematics

Abstract: Graph-partitioning problems are a central topic of research in
the study of algorithms and complexity theory. They are of interest to
theoreticians with connections to error correcting codes, sampling
algorithms, metric embeddings, among others, and to practitioners, as
algorithms for graph partitioning can be used as fundamental building
blocks in many applications. One of the central problems studied in this
field is the sparsest cut problem, where we want to compute the cut which
has the least ratio of number of edges cut to size of smaller side of the
cut. This ratio is known as the expansion of the cut.
In this talk, I will talk about higher order variants of expansion (i.e.
notions of expansion corresponding to partitioning the graph into more
than two pieces, etc.), and how they relate to the graph's eigenvalues.
The proofs will also show how to use the graph's eigenvectors to compute
partitions satisfying these bounds. Based on joint works with Prasad
Raghavendra, Prasad Tetali and Santosh Vempala.
