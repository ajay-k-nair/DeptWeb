Title: Diamond lemma for group graded quasi-algebras

Abstract: Quasi-algebras were introduced as algebras in a monoidal
category. Since the associativity constraints in these categories are
allowed to be nontrivial, the class of quasi-algebras contains various
important examples of non-associative algebras like the octonions and
other Cayley algebras.
The diamond lemma is a reduction method used in algebra. The original
diamond lemma was stated in graph theory by Newman which was later
generalized to associative algebras by Bergman. In this talk, we will see
the analog of this lemma for the group graded quasi-algebras with some
interesting examples like octonion algebra and generalized octonions
