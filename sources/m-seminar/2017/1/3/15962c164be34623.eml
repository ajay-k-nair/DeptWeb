Title: Siegel-Veech transforms are in L2

Abstract: Let H denote a connected component of a stratum of translation
surfaces. We show that the Siegel-Veech transform of a bounded compactly
supported function on R2 is in L2(H,&#956;), where &#956; is the
Masur-Veech measure on H, and give applications to bounding error terms
for counting problems for saddle connections. We will review classical
results in the Geometry of Numbers which anticipate this result. This is
joint work with Yitwah Cheung and Howard Masur.
