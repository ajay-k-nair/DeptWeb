 Title: Conformal blocks, strange duality and the moduli space of curves.
>
> Abstract: Conformal blocks are refined invariants of tensor product of
> representations of a Lie algebra that give a special class of vector
> bundles on the moduli space of curves. In this talk, I will introduce
> conformal blocks and explore connections to questions in algebraic
> geometry
> and representation theory. I will also focus on some ``strange" dualities
> in representation theory and how they give equalities of divisor classes
> on
> the moduli space of curves.
