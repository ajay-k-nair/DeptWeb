Title: Volume distribution of nodal domains of random band-limited functions

Date: 27/April/2017 (Thursday)

Venue: LH-1, department of mathematics

Time: 2:15-3:15 PM

Abstract: This is a joint work with Dmitry Beliaev. We study the volume 
distribution of nodal domains of random band-limited functions on generic 
manifolds, and find that in the high energy limit a typical instance obeys a 
deterministic universal law, independent of the manifold. Some of the basic 
qualitative properties of this law, such as its support, monotonicity and 
continuity of the cumulative probability function, are established.

Title: Nodal intersections of random toral eigenfunctions against a  test curve

Date: 27/April/2017 (Thursday)

Venue: LH-1, department of mathematics

Time: 3:30-4:30 PM

Absract: This talk is based on joint works with Zeev Rudnick, and Maurizia 
Rossi. We investigate the number of nodal intersections of random Gaussian 
Laplace eigenfunctions on the standard 2-dimensional flat torus (“arithmetic 
random waves”) with a fixed reference curve. The expected intersection number 
is universally proportional to the length of the reference curve, times the 
wavenumber, independent of the geometry. 

Our first result prescribes the asymptotic behaviour of the nodal intersections 
variance for generic smooth curves in the high energy limit; remarkably, it is 
dependent on both the angular distribution of lattice points lying on the 
circle with radius corresponding to the given wavenumber, and the geometry of 
the given curve. For these curves we can prove the Central Limit Theorem. We 
then construct some examples of exceptional "static" curves where the variance 
is of smaller order of magnitude, and the limit distribution is non-Gaussian.
