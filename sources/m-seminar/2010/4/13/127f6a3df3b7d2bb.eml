Abstract:
     The most immediate way to use classical homotopy theory to
study topological spaces endowed with extra structures, such as
complex spaces, is to forget these structures and study the underlying
topological space. Usually this procedure is inadequate since what we
are forgetting is not homotopy invariant nor topological invariant.
There are more sophisticated approaches to use homotopy theory to try
to detect different complex structures on the same topological space
which prove to be effective, for instance if the topological space is
a complex variety and the complex structures endow the tangent bundle
of different Chern classes/numbers.
A much more thorough approach can be achieved by using model category
theory to provide the category of complex spaces with holomorphic maps
of an homotopy theory which realizes to the ordinary topological one,
it is biholomorphic but not topological invariant. These techniques
have been previously implemented by Morel and Voevodsky to create the
so called "A^1 homotopy theory of algebraic varieties" few years ago.

Within such an abstract nonsense, a surprising relation with the
concept of Brody hyperbolicity of complex spaces arises. We will
discuss this link and how certain groups (which we called "holotopy
groups" in analogy with the classical homotopy groups) might be used
to prove non hyperbolicity of complex spaces.


           All are Welcome.
