Title	: The Cauchy-Riemann equations in a product domain

Time	: 4:00-5:00 p.m.

Venue	: Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
An important question in complex analysis is to solve the inhomogenous
Cauchy-Riemann equations (also called the d-bar equation) in a domain
in C^n. The question of boundary smoothness in the d-bar problem is
classically dealt with by solving the associated d-bar Neumann problem
and showing that the solution operator, the $\overline{\partial}$-Neumann
operator is compact. For many domains of interest, in particular the
product domains, this approach fails. We discuss in this talk some new
results on the regularity of the d-bar problem in product domains.
This work is joint with Mei-Chi Shaw.
