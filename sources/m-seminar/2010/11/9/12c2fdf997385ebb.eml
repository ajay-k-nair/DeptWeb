                             Abstract:

 Higher cognitive functions require the coordination of large assemblies of
 spatially distributed neurons in ever changing constellations. It is
 proposed that this coordination is achieved through temporal coordination
 of oscillatory activity in specific frequency bands. Since there is no
 supra-ordinate command centre in the brain, the respective patterns of
 synchronous activity self-organize, which has important implications on
 concepts of intentionality and top down causation. Evidence will be
 provided that synchronisation supports response selection by attention,
 feature binding, subsystem integration, short-term memory, flexible
 routing of signals across cortical networks and access to the work-space
 of consciousness. The precision of synchronisation is in the millisecond
 range, suggesting the possibility that information is encoded not only in
 the co-variation of discharge rates but also in the precise timing of
 individual action potentials. This could account for the high speed with
 which cortical circuits can encode and process information. Recent studies
 in schizophrenic patients indicate that this disorder is associated with
 abnormal synchronisation of oscillatory activity in the high frequency
 range (beta and gamma). This suggests that some of the cognitive deficits
 characteristic for this disease result from deficient binding and
 subsystem integration.
