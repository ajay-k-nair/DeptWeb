Abstract:
This talk is on a topic in number theory, but should be accessible to
a general mathematical audience.

Let f be a Hecke cusp form of weight k. How is f distributed in size ?
I will discuss joint work with V. Blomer and M. Young, in which we give
the first nontrivial upper bound for the L-4 norm of f in terms of k.
