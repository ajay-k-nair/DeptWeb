Abstract:
Two key steps devised by Harish Chandra for his construction of the
global characters of discrete series for a non-compact real semisimple
Lie group involve

  i) 	transferring questions on the group to questions on the Lie
 	algebra;

 ii)	reducing harmonic analysis on the group to harmonic analysis
 	on the collection of its Cartan subgroups using integration
 	over orbits.

We will attempt to simply summarize some of the main ingredients that go
into Harish Chandra's formulation and execution of these steps. We will
conclude by presenting a geometric realization of the representations
belonging to the discrete series, notably due to Narasimhan and Okamoto.
