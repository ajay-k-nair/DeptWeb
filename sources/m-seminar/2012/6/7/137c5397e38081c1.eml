Abstract:
The notion of a GKM graph was introduced by Guillemin-Zara [1],
motivated by a result of Goresky-Kottwitz-MacPherson [2]. A GKM
graph is a regular graph with directions assigned to edges satisfying
certain compatibility condition. The 1-skeleton of a simple polytope
provides an example of a GKM graph. One can associate a GKM
graph $\mathcal{G}_M$ to a closed manifold $M$ with an action of a
compact torus satisfying certain conditions (those manifolds are often
called GKM manifolds). Many important manifolds such as toric manifolds
and flag manifolds are GKM manifolds. The GKM graph $\mathcal{G}_M$
contains a lot of geometrical information on $M$, e.g. the (equivariant)
cohomology of $M$ can be recovered by $\mathcal{G}_M$. I will present
an overview of some facts on GKM graphs.
