Abstract:

Title: Topological Rigidity

Abstract:
Mostow proved that n-dimensional closed (compact with empty boundary)
Riemannian manifolds M and N with constant -1 sectional curvatures
and isomorphic fundamental groups are isometric when n>2. In the more
general setting where the sectional curvatures are negative but not
necessarily constant, isometry is clearly too much to expect. But
diffeomorphism or at least homeomorphism seemed plausible. I will discuss
why homeomorphism is true when n>4. This is joint work with Lowell Jones.
