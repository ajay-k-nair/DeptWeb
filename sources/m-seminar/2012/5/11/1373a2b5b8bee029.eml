Abstract:
This work is concerned with two different problems in harmonic analysis,
one on the Heisenberg group and other on $\mathbb{R}^n$, as described in
the following two paragraphs respectively.

Let $\mathbb{H}^n$ be the $(2n+1)$-dimensional Heisenberg group, and let
$K$ be a compact subgroup of $U(n)$ such that $(K,\mathbb{H}^n)$ is a
Gelfand pair. Also assume that the $K$-action on $\mathbb{C}^n$ is polar.
We prove a Hecke-Bochner identity associated to the Gelfand pair
$(K,\mathbb{H}^n)$. For the special case $K=U(n)$, this was proved by
Geller, giving a formula for the Weyl transform of a function $f$ of the
type $f=Pg$, where $g$ is a radial function, and $P$ a bigraded solid
$U(n)$-harmonic polynomial. Using our general Hecke-Bochner identity we
also characterize (under some conditions) joint eigenfunctions of all
differential operators on $\mathbb{H}^n$ that are invariant under the
action of $K$ and the left action of $\mathbb{H}^n$.

We consider convolution equations of the type $f*T=g$, where $f,g\in
L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and $T$ is a compactly supported distribution. Under
natural assumptions on the zero set of the Fourier transform of $T$, we
show that $f$ is compactly supported, provided $g$ is.



 		    ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED.
