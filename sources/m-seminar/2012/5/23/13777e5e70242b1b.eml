Abstract:
Given a domain D in the complex plane and a compact subset K, Runge's
theorem provides conditions on K which guarantee that a given function
that is holomorphic in some neighbourhood of K can be approximated on K
by a holomorphic function on D. We look at an analogous theorem on
non-compact Riemann surfaces, i.e., Runge's approximation theorem,
stated and proved by Malgrange. We revisit Malgrange's proof of the
theorem, invoking a very basic result in distribution  theory: Weyl's
lemma. We look at two main applications of Runge's theorem. Firstly,
every open Riemann surface is Stein and secondly the triviality of
holomorphic vector bundles on non-compact Riemann surfaces. Next, we
look at the Gunning-Narasimhan theorem which states that
every open (connected) Riemann surface can be immersed into $\mathbb{C}$.
We discuss the proof of this theorem as well, which depends on Runge's
theorem too. Finally we contrast the compact case to the non-compact
case, by showing that every compact Riemann surface can be embedded
into a large enough complex projective space.
