Abstract:
    The curvature of a contraction T in the Cowen-Douglas
class is bounded above by the curvature of the backward shift
operator. However, in general, an operator satisfying the
curvature inequality need not be contractive. In this talk we
characterize a slightly smaller class of contractions using a
stronger form of the curvature inequality.  Along the way, we find
conditions on the metric of the holomorphic Hermitian vector
bundle E corresponding to the operator T in the Cowen-Douglas
class which ensures negative definiteness of the curvature
function. We obtain a generalization for commuting tuples of
operators in the Cowen-Douglas class.

In the second part we will discuss the construction of a Hermitian
holomorphic jet bundle $J_k(E)$ starting with a Hermitian holomorphic
vector bundle $E$ over an open subset $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{C}$. In the
special
case, when the the Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle $E$ is the
pull-back of the tutological bundle on the Grassmannian of some Hilbert
space $\mathcal{H}$, we will derive a compact formula for the curvature
of the vector bundle. Several properties of the curvature of the Hermitian
holomorphic jet bundle $J_k(E)$ is then derived using the curvature
formula for the vector bundle $E$.
