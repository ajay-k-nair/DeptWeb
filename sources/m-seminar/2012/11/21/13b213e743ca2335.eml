Dear all,

                         Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                         M.S. THESIS DEFENCE


Speaker  :   Mr. Samya Kumar Ray

Title    :   GROTHENDIECK INEQUALITY

Date     :   November 21, 2012 (Wednesday)

Time     :   4:10 p.m.- 5:10 p.m.

Venue    :   Department of Mathematics, LH-I

Abstract:
Grothendieck published an extraordinary paper entitled ”Resume de la
theorie metrique des produits tensoriels topologiques” in 1953. The main
result of this paper is the inequality which is commonly known as
Grothendieck Inequality. Following Kirivine, in this article, we give the
proof of Grothendieck Inequality. We reformulate it in different forms. We
also investigate the famous Grothendieck constant KG. The Grothendieck
constant was achieved by taking supremum over a special class of matrices.
But our attempt will be to investigate it, considering a smaller class of
matrices, namely only the positive definite matrices in this class.

            ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED.

Faculty members and students of the Department are requested to attend.



                                            Chairman,
                                            Department of Mathematics
