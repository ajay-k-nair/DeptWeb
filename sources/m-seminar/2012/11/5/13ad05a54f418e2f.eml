Dear all,


   GEOMETRY TOPOLOGY INFORMAL SEMINAR

Speaker : David Farris

Title: The Whitney-Grauert theorem via contact geometry

Date: 6 November (Tuesday)

Time: 2.00 pm

Venue: Department of Mathematics, LH-III

Abstract: The Whitney-Grauert theorem states that regular curves in R^2
(i.e. immersions of S^1) are classified up to regular homotopy by the
winding number of the derivative.  I will present Eliashberg and Geiges's
simple proof of this theorem, in which regular plane curves are realized as
projections of curves in R^3 satisfying a certain geometric condition
(they'll be Legendrian curves in the standard contact structure).  This is
one of the simplest examples of the general pattern of lifting a purely
topological problem to an equivalent but simpler problem in
contact/symplectic geometry.  No knowledge of contact geometry is assumed;
the only prerequisite is differential forms on R^3.

                    All are cordially invited.
