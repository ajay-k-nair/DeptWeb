Dear all,


GEOMETRY TOPOLOGY INFORMAL SEMINAR


Speaker : T. V. H. Prathamesh

Title: Construction of Jones Polynomial for Knots (via Braid Groups and
Hecke Algebras)

Date: 27th November (Tuesday)

Time: 3.30 pm

Venue: Department of Mathematics, LH-III

Abstract: Jones Polynomial is an invariant of an oriented knot or link
which assigns to each oriented knot or link a Laurent polynomial in the
variable t^{1/2} with integer coefficients. Though can be computed easily
in terms of what are called skein relations, it originally arose from a
studying a particular kind of a 'trace' of braid representations into an
algebra derived as the quotient of a group ring of braid group. We shall
discuss this construction of Jones Polynomial in the first talk. In the
second part, we shall discuss the construction of Jones Polynomial from
the tangle representation of Knots.

Prerequisites: I would assume familiarity with the definition of a Knot
and the definition of Ambient Isotopy

          All are cordially invited.
