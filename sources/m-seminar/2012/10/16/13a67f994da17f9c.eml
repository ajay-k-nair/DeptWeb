Title:        Stable allocations

Abstract: This is an informal lecture to celebrate the unprecedented
event that I understand some piece of the work of some economists.

Roth and Shapley have won the "The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic
Sciences" (aka nobel prize in Economics) for their work on 'stable
allocations and market design'. It is also a thriving subject in
mathematics. I will start with the original Gale-Shapley problem:

  10 men and 10 women are to be married to each other so that there are no
divorces. Is it possible?

Then we proceed to the question of 'how to allocate patients to
hospitals' or 'children to schools'. In the end I shall talk about
another allocation problem motivated by the above. The entire talk will be
very elementary and understandable to undergraduates.



            ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED,




                                            Chairman,
                                            Department of Mathematics
