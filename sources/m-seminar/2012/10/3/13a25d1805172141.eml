Title: A Google Course-builder course - Hyperbolic Spaces and Groups

Speaker: Siddhartha Gadgil

Date: Friday, October 5, 2012.

Time: 3:00 p.m.

Venue: LH-III, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
    Google has recently released open source software  called
`course-builder' (at https://code.google.com/p/course-builder/) to
make interactive online courses consisting of videos interleaved with
quizzes. In this brief presentation, I will show as an example a
course-builder course I made and describe the process of making such
courses. My goal is to convince that making online courses is both
easy and worthwhile.
