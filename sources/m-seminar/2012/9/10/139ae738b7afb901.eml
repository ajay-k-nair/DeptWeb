Abstract:

 Let S be a group which is a semi-direct product of R^n
and R^d, R^d acting of R^n in a appropriate way (that will be
specified during the talk). Given a left-invariant second order
elliptic operator L on S (under suitable assumptions) there is
smooth, positive integrable function on R^n called a Poisson
kernel that reproduces bounded L harmonic functions on S. It turns out
that P dx is the stationary measure for a random recursion
X_{n+1}=f_{n+1}(X_n) where f_1, f_2,... are independent equally
distributed random transformations of R^n, and X_n are defined
recursively, X_0 being a constant vector. The law of f_1 is
closely related to the heat kernel for L. P dx is the law of the
limit of X_n. The situation can be generalized to transformations
f having the law with no relation to a differential operator
giving rise to a family of affine stochastic recursions who's
stationary measures are of interest. Among them are the classical
ones considered by Kesten, Vervaat, Grincevicius, Goldie and more
recent ones considered by Alsmeyer - Mentemeier, Guivarc'h - Le
Page, Guivarc'h - Buraczewski and myself. Asymptotics at infinity
of stationary measures will be described.
