Title :       Rational points on Elliptic curves and congruences between
modular forms

Date :       August 24th, 2012

Time :       4:00 pm- 5:00 pm

Venue:     Department of Mathematics, Lecture Hall 1


Abstract:
Rational points on elliptic curves have found applications in cryptography
and in the solution to some problems dating back to antiquity. However, we
still do not know how to find an elliptic curve with as many points as
possible. In this talk, we will see how the theory of modular forms (of
Ramanujan) along with a recently developed theory enables one to understand
this problem. Along the way, we will see how congruences between
coefficients of modular forms shed light on this problem.
