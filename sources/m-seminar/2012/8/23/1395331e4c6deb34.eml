Abstract:
We study several kinds of matching problems between two point processes.
First we consider the set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$. We assign a color red
or blue with probability 1/2 to each integer. We match each red integer to
a blue integer using some algorithm and analyze the matched edge length of
the integer zero. Next we go to $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. We consider matching
between two different point processes and analyze a typical matched edge
length $X$. There we see that the results vary significantly in different
dimensions. In dimensions one and two (d=1,2), even $E[X^{d/2}]$ does not
exist. On the other hand in dimensions more than two (d>2),
$E[\exp(cX^{d})]$ exist, where $c$ is a constant depends on $d$ only.

Next we discuss about matching problems in a finite setting, namely in a
unit square.  Take $n$ red points and $n$ blue points chosen independently
and uniformly in a unit square. There are $n!$ many possible matchings
between these red and blue points. We investigate the optimal average
matched edge length and the minimum of the maximum matched edge lengths,
where the minimum is over all possible $n!$ matchings. There we see that
the optimal average matched edge length is like $\sqrt{\frac{\log n}{n}}$
and the min-max matched edge length is like $\frac{(\log
n)^{3/4}}{\sqrt{n}}$.
