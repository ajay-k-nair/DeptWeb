Abstract:
Let D_1,...D_n be a system of commuting, formally self-adjoint, left
invariant operators on a Lie group G. Under suitable hypotheses, we show
that D_1,...D_n are essentially self-adjoint on L^2(G) and admit a joint
spectral resolution, and we characterize their joint L^2 spectrum as the
set of eigenvalues corresponding to a class of generalized joint
eigenfunctions. Moreover, in the case G is a homogeneous group and
D_1,...D_n are homogeneous, we obtain L^p-boundedness results for
operators of the form m(D_1,...D_n), analogous to the
Mihlin-Hormander and Marcinkiewicz multiplier theorems.
