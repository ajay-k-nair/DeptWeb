Dear All,

Title    :   Diophantine approximation, arithmetic groups, and ergodic theory

Date     :   January 2nd, 2013 (Wednesday)

Time     :   4:00 pm- 5:00pm

Venue    :   Department of Mathematics, LH-II

Abstract: One of the main goals of classical metric Diophantine
approximation is to quantify the denseness of the rational numbers in the
real numbers, or more generally, of Q^d in R^d. An equally natural problem
is to quantify the denseness of the rational points on the sphere, and more
generally, rational points in other compact and non-compact algebraic
sub-varieties in R^d. We will describe a solution to this problem for a large
class of homogeneous varieties.

The method we use is based on a general quantitative duality principle in
homogeneous dynamics that we develop, and on spectral estimates of ergodic
averages using the theory of automorphic forms.

Based on joint work with Alex Gorodnik, and on joint work with Anish Ghosh
and Alex Gorodnik.



            ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED,




                                            Chairman,
