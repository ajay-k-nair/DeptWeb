Dear All,


                         Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                        SEMINAR

Speaker   :   Prof Amos Nevo
                    Technion, Israel

Title    :   Mean ergodic theorems : from amenable to non-amenable groups

Date     :   December 31st, 2012 (Monday)

Time     :   4:00 pm- 5:00pm

Venue    :   Department of Mathematics, LH-II

Abstract : We will trace the evolution of the mean ergodic theorem, from its
original formulation by von-Neumann to some very recent formulations valid in
the context of algebraic groups and their lattice subgroups. We will then
present
a variety of recent applications of mean ergodic theorems, particularly to
counting
lattice points.

Based partly on joint work with Alex Gorodnik.



            ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED,
