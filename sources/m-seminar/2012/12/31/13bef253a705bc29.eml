Title    :   Mean ergodic theorems : from amenable to non-amenable groups

Date     :   December 31st, 2012 (Monday)

Time     :   4:00 pm- 5:00pm

Venue    :   Department of Mathematics, LH-I

Abstract : We will trace the evolution of the mean ergodic theorem, from its
original formulation by von-Neumann to some very recent formulations valid in
the context of algebraic groups and their lattice subgroups. We will then
present a variety of recent applications of mean ergodic theorems,
particularly to counting lattice points.

Based partly on joint work with Alex Gorodnik.
