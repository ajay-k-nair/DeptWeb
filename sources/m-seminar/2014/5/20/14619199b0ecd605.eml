Abstract:
Gromov’s compactness theorem for metric spaces, a compactness theorem for the 
space of compact metric spaces equipped with the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, is 
a landmark theorem with many applications. We give a generalisation of this 
result - more precisely, we prove a compactness theorem for the space of 
distance measure spaces equipped with the generalised 
Gromov-Hausdorff-Levi-Prokhorov distance. A distance measure space is a triple 
(X, d, μ), where (X, d) forms a distance space (a generalisation of a metric 
space where, we allow the distance between two points to be infinity) and μ is 
a finite Borel measure.

Using this result, we prove that the Deligne-Mumford compactifiaction is the 
completion of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces under generalised 
Gromov-Hausdorff-Levi-Prokhorov distance. The Deligne-Mumford compactification, 
a compactification of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces with explicit 
description of the limit points, and the closely related Gromov's compactness 
theorem for pseudo-holomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds (in particular 
curves in an algebraic variety) are important results for many areas of 
mathematics.

While Gromov's compactness theorem for pseudo-holomorphic curves is an 
important tool in symplectic topology, its applicability is limited due to the 
non-existence of a general method to construct pseudo-holomorphic curves. 
Considering a more general class of domains (in place of Riemann surfaces) is 
likely to be useful. Riemann surface laminations are a natural generalisation 
of Riemann surfaces. Theorems such as the uniformisation theorem for surface 
laminations due to Alberto Candel (which is a partial generalisation of the 
uniformisation theorem for surfaces), generalisations of the Gauss-Bonnet 
theorem proved for some special cases, and the topological classification of 
“almost all" leaves using harmonic measures reinforces the usefulness of this 
line on enquiry. Also, the success of essential laminations,as generalised 
incompressible surfaces, in the study of 3-manifolds suggests that a similar 
approach may be useful in symplectic topology. With this motivation we prove a 
compactness theorem analogous to the Deligne-Mumford compactification for the 
space of Riemann surface laminations.




All are cordially invited!
