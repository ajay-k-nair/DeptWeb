Dear all,

                           Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR

Title   : Roots of Units, or A sum worthy of Gauss

Date    : 6th May, 2014 (Tuesday)

Time    : 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
One looks at a certain sum G involving the p-th roots of unity (where p is
a prime number), called the quadratic gaussian sum. It is easy to see that
G^2=p, which means that G itself is either the positive or the negative
square root of p.  Which one ? It took Gauss many years to find the answer
and to prove the result.  Since then some other proofs of this result have
been given, and it has become the central example of what is called the
"root number" of an L-function.  So the result is very important.


All are cordially invited!
