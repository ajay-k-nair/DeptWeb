Dear all,

                          Department of Mathematics
                   Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore

                                   SEMINAR


Speaker : Prof. Rukmini Dey (HRI)

Title: Constant Mean Curvature surfaces

Date: 5th June, 2014 (Thursday)

Time: 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue: Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract: In this expository talk, I will focus on  CMC surfaces which
are not minimal surfaces. I will talk about the link between CMC
surfaces and integrable systems. I will then talk about how CMC
surfaces fall out of a constrained optimization problem. I will give
examples of rotational and helicoidal CMC surfaces and the isometry
between them. If time permits I will talk about  the classification
of CMC surfaces, namely its Weirstrass representation.



All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
