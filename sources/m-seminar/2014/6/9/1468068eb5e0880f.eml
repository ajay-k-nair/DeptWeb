Dear all,

                   Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore

                                   SEMINAR


Speaker : Prof. Sivaram Ambikasaran (Courant Institute of Mathematical 
Sciences, NYU)

Title: Analysis based fast algorithms for applied mathematics

Date: 12th June, 2014 (Thursday)

Time: 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue: Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract: The dominant problem in applied mathematics is the application
of linear operators and solving linear equations. Dense linear systems
arise in numerous applications: Boundary integral equations for elliptic
partial differential equations, covariance matrices in statistics,
Bayesian inversion, Kalman filtering, inverse problems, radial basis
function interpolation, density functional theory, multi-frontal
solvers for sparse linear systems, etc. As the problem size increases,
large memory requirements scaling as $O(N^2)$ and extensive
computational time to perform matrix algebra scaling as $O(N^2)$ or
$O(N^3)$ make computations impractical, where $N$ is the underlying
number of degrees of freedom. This talk will discuss new fast algorithms
that scale as $O(N)$ for a class of problems, given a prescribed
tolerance. Applications in the context of Gaussian processes, Integral
equations for electromagnetic scattering, Symmetric factorization for Brownian 
dynamics, Bayesian inversion, Kalman filtering, multi-frontal solvers will also 
be presented.




All are cordially invited!
