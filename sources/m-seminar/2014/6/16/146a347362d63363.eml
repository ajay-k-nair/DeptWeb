Abstract:
This thesis investigates two different types of  problems in multi
variable operator theory. The first one deals with the defect sequence for
contractive tuples and maximal contractive tuples. The second one deals
with the wandering subspaces of the Bergman space and the Dirichilet space
over polydisc. These are described in (I) and (II) below.

(I) The defect sequence for contractive tuples and maximal contractive
tuples:
  We introduce the defect sequence for a contractive tuple of Hilbert space 
operators and investigate its properties. We show that there are upper bounds 
for the defect dimensions.  The upper bounds are different in the 
non-commutative and in the commutative case. The tuples for which these upper 
bounds are obtained, are called maximal contractive tuples. We show that the 
creation operator tuple  on the full Fock space and the co
ordinate multipliers  on the Drury-Arveson space  are maximal. We also
investigate the maximality of the compression operator tuple on the full
Fock space. We show that if M is an invariant subspace under the creation
operator tuple, then the restriction  is always maximal. But the
situation is  different for co-invariant subspaces. A characterization for a 
contractive tuple to be maximal is obtained. We define the notion of maximality 
for a submodule of the Drury-Arveson module on the d-dimensional unit ball. 
For d=1, it is shown that every submodule of the Hardy module over the unit 
disc is maximal. But for d>2 we prove that any homogeneous submodule or 
submodule generated by polynomials is not maximal. We obtain a characterization 
of maximal submodules of the Drury-Arveson module. We also study pure tuples 
and see how the defect dimensions play a role in their irreducibility.

(II) Wandering subspace problem: We investigate the following question : Let 
(T_1, ....., T_n) be a commuting n-tuple of bounded linear operators on a 
Hilbert space H. Does there exist a generating wandering subspace W for (T_1, 
....., T_n)? We got some affirmative answer for the doubly commuting invariant 
subspaces of the Bergman space and the Dirichlet space over the unit polydisc. 
We show that for any doubly commuting invariant subspace  of the Bergman space 
or the Dirichlet space over polydisc, the tuple consists  of restrictions of 
co-ordinate multiplication operators always possesses generating wandering 
subspace.



All are cordially invited!
