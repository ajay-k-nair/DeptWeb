Title   : How to integrate entire functions in polar coordinates?

Date    : 14th Feb, 2014 (Friday)

Time    : 2:00 - 3:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
In this talk we address the problem of integrating entire
functions (of several complex variables) in 'polar coordinates'!

Title   : Tight triangulated manifolds

Date    : 14th Feb, 2014 (Friday)

Time    : 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
Wolfgang Kuhnel introduced the notion of tightness and conjectured that
all tight triangulations of closed manifolds are strongly minimal. In a
recent paper with B. Datta (European J. Comb. 36 (2014), 294--313), the
speaker obtained a very general combinatorial criterion for tightness and
found results in partial confirmation of this conjecture. We shall discuss
these results.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
