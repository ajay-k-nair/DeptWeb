Dear all,

                           Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : Prof Konstantin Khanin
          University of Toronto

Title   : On weak universality for directed polymers

Date    : 10th Feb, 2014 (Monday)

Time    : 3:15 - 4:15 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
The talk is based on a joint paper with T.Alberts and J.Quastel.
We consider directed polymers in a random environment.
However the inverse temperature is scaled  with the length of
a polymer. It turn out that with a proper critical scaling one can get a
nontrivial universal behaviour for the partition function and the
end point distribution. Moreover the limiting partition function
distribution asymptotically converges to the Tracy-Widom law as the
rescaled inverse temperature tends to infinity.


All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
