Dear all, there will be two lectures on Wednesday in the Bangalore
probability seminar.

    BANGALORE PROBABILITY SEMINAR

Speaker : Koushik Ramachandran (ISI, Bangalore)

Title   : Asymptotic behavior of positive harmonic functions in some
unbounded domains

Date    : 18th August, 2014 (Monday)

Time    : 2:00 - 3:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract: This talk will concern asymptotic estimates at infinity for
positive harmonic functions in a large class of non-smooth unbounded
domains. These are domains whose sections, after rescaling, resemble a
Lipschitz cylinder or a Lipschitz cone, e.g., various paraboloids and
horns. We will also mention a few related results in probability, e.g
harmonic measure (distribution of exit position of Brownian motion)
estimates.



Speaker : Subhroshekhar Ghosh (Princeton)

Title   : Large deviations for random polynomials: exponential coefficients

Date    : 18th August, 2014 (Monday)

Time    : 3:15 - 4:15 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract: We obtain a large deviations principle (in the space of
probability measures on $\C$) for the empirical measure of zeroes of
random polynomials with i.i.d. exponential coefficients. One of the key
challenges here is the fact that the coefficients are a.s. all positive,
which enforces a growing number of non-linear constraints on the locations
of the zeroes. En route, we will discuss a recent characterization theorem
of Bergweiler, Eremenko and Sokal, and its application in the proof of our
main theorem.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
