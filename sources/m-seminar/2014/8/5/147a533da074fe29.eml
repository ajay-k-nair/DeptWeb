Title   : Vector-valued weighted inequalities for one-sided maximal functions

Date    : 5th August, 2014 (Tuesday)

Time    : 4:00 - 5:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
In this talk we shall briefly discuss the theory of one-sided
maximal functions. One-sided maximal function is a variant of the
classical Hardy-Littlewood maximal function. The theory of one-sided
maximal functions is an active research area. Specially, in the past two
decades there has been a lot of research activities in this area.

The main focus of this talk would be on vector-valued weighted
inequalities for one-sided maximal operators.
The weighted L^p-inequalities for these operators were first
obtained by E.~Sawyer. He gave a complete
characterization of weight functions \omega (known as A^+_p
weights) for which the one-sided maximal operator
is bounded from weighted Lebesgue space L^p_{\omega}(\R) into
itself. In this talk we extend Sawyer's weighted
inequalities for one-sided maximal operator to the case of
l_r-valued functions defined on \R. We shall also
prove an analogue of the well-known Fefferman-Stein's weighted lemma and
its vector-valued extension in the
context of one-sided maximal functions.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
