Title   : On splitting of primes and simple extensions of integrally
closed domains

Date    : 15th December, 2014 (Monday)

Time    : 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract
We will discuss an extension of the classical Dedekind's theorem regarding
splitting of rational primes in algebraic number fields as well as of its
converse when the base field is a valued field of arbitrary rank. Let R be
the valuation ring of a Krull valuation defined on a field K and S be the
integral closure of R in a finite extension L of K: A set of conditions
will be described which are necessary as well as sufficient for S to be a
simple ring extension of R; i.e., S = R[] for some : The well known
theorem of Dedekind characterizing those rational primes p which divide
the index of an algebraic number field will be deduced. Some related open
problems will also be mentioned.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
