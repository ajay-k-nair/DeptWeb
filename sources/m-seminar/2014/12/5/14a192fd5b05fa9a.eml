Title   : Rational loop space homology of homogeneous spaces

Date    : 5th December, 2014 (Friday)

Time    : 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
We  recall some facts about Rational Homotopy Theory, from both Sullivan
and Quillen points of view. We show how to find a Sullivan model of a
homogeneous space  G/H . Let  M  be a closed oriented smooth manifold of
dimension  d  and  LM= map(S^1, M)  denote the space of free loops on  M .
Using intersection products, Chass and Sullivan defined a product on
\mathbb{H}_*(LM)=H_{*+d} (LM)   that turns to be a graded commutative
algebra and defined a bracket on  \mathbb{H}_*(LM)   making of it a
Gerstenhaber algebra. From the work of Jones, Cohen, F\'elix, Thomas and
others there is an isomorphism of Gerstenhaber algebras between the
Hochschild cohomology   HH^*(C^*(M), C^*(M))  and  \mathbb{H}_*(LM) .
Using a Sullivan model    (\land V, d)  of  M , we show that that the
Gerstenhaber bracket  can be computed  in terms of derivations on   (\land
V, d) .  Precisely, we show that   HH^*(\land V, \land V)   is isomorphic
to   H_*(\land(V)\otimes  \land Z , D) , where  Z  is the dual of  V .  We
will illustrate with computations for homogeneous spaces.

 Moreover the action   S^1  on  LM  defines a Batalin-Vilkoevisky
structure   \mathbb{H}_*(LM)   extending the Grestenhaber bracket. It was
shown by various  people that   HH^*(C^*(M), C^*(M))  can be  endowed
with a BV-structure extending the Gerstenhaber bracket. We can also
define a BV-structure on   (\land(V)\otimes  \land Z  , however the
relationship with any other  BV -structure is still to be established.

All are cordially invited!
