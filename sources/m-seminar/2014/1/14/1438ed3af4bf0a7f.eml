Dear all,

We are planning to organize monthly mathematical meetings under the title
of _Eigen-Functions_. We will have two talks by people working in
mathematical fields. The idea is to improve interaction and communication
in our department among faculty, postdocs and students. These will be held
on the third Friday of every month during the semester periods.

The first session will be on Jan 17th. Our schedule for the first
Eigen-Function meeting is as follows.

2:00-3:00pm:    Nisheeth Vishnoi, Microsoft Research
3:00-3:30pm:    Tea break
3:30-4:30pm:    Krishna Athreya, IISc and Iowa State


The titles and abstracts follow.

Title   : Approximation Theory and the Design of Fast Algorithms

Date    : 17th Jan, 2014 (Friday)

Time    : 2:00 - 3:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
I will talk about techniques to approximate real functions such as
$x^s,$ $x^{-1}$ and $e^{-x}$ by "simpler" functions and how these
results can be used in the design of fast algorithms. The key lies
in the fact that such approximations imply faster ways to
approximate primitives such as $A^sv,$ $A^{-1}v$ and $\exp({-A})v$,
and in the computation of matrix eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
Indeed, many fast algorithms reduce to the computation of such
primitives, which have proved useful for speeding up several
fundamental computations, such as random walk simulation, graph
partitioning, solving linear systems of equations, and combinatorial
approaches for solving semi-definite programs.

Title   : Statistical estimation of integrals over infinite measure spaces

Date    : 17th Jan, 2014 (Friday)

Time    : 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
Given a L1 function f over an infinite measure space S how does one
estimate the integral of f using statistical tools? In this talk we
propose using regenerative sequences with heavy tails to do this. We
obtain a consistent estimator and show the rate of
convergence is slower than 1/root n. When S is countable the SSRW
works.


All are cordially invited!
