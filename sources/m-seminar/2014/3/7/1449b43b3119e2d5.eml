Dear all,

                           Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                 COLLOQUIUM



Speaker : Gerard Besson
          Fourier Institut, Grenoble

Title   : On open three-manifolds

Date    : 7th March, 2014 (Friday)

Time    : 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
We will describe quite carefully two classes of open three-manifolds. For
one of them almost nothing is known about its Riemannian geometry and we
will state open questions. For the second class a theorem is available as
well as a complete classification.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
