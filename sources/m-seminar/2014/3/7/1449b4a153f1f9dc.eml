Speaker : Esha Chatterjee Ghosh


Title   : On the global character of the solutions of some nonlinear
difference equations

Date    : 21st March, 2014 (Friday)

Time    : 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall III, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
Non linear difference equations of order more than one is a relatively new
and dynamic area of research in applied mathematics. In particular, the
theory of Rational difference equations emerged in the last two decades
and is an ongoing challenging field of study. In this talk we will present
a brief introduction to nonlinear difference equations with some
applications to various fields. Some techniques used in the qualitative
analysis of the global character of solutions will be outlined. We will
also discuss the results of a recent paper in which the speaker has
addressed and generalized, an open problem posed by E. Camouzis and G.
Ladas.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
