                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : Herve Gaussier

Title   : On the Gromov hyperbolicity of convex domains

Date    : 5th March, 2014 (Wednesday)

Time    : 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
We discuss the Gromov hyperbolicity of the Kobayashi metric on smooth
convex domains in Euclidean space. We prove that if the boundary contains
a holomorphic disc then the domain is not hyperbolic. On the other hand we
give examples of convex (but not strongly pseudoconvex) domains which are
hyperbolic. This is a joint work with Harish Seshadri.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
