Title   : Quadrature domains - an introduction

Date    : 28th March, 2014 (Friday)

Time    : 2:00 - 3:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
Quadrature domains are those on which holomorphic functions satisfy a
generalized mean value equality. The purpose of this talk will be to
reflect on the Schwarz reflection principle and to understand how it leads
to examples of quadrature domains.

Title   : Recent progress towards the twin prime conjecture

Date    : 28th March, 2014 (Friday)

Time    : 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
A great progress on the twin prime problem was made last year by
Yitang Zhang and it made him famous in Mathematical circles almost
overnight. He proved the existence of a positive real number M such that
there are infinitely many pairs of primes that differ by at most M. The
twin
prime conjecture predicts that M can be taken to be two. I shall give an
overview of the works leading up to Zhang's spectacular achievement.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
