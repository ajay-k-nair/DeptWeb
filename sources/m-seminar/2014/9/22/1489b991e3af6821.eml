Dear all,

                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : Samarpita Ray

Title   : Derived Category of N-complexes

Date    : 22nd September, 2014 (Monday)

Time    : 2:00 - 3:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
The notion of N-complexes goes back to a 1996 preprint of Kapranov, in
which he considered chains of composable morphisms satisfying  d^N = 0 (as
opposed to the usual $d^2 = 0$ which gives the usual chain complexes).
Later on, much of the usual homological algebra for chain complexes
(homotopy of morphisms, spectral sequences, etc) was generalized to
N-complexes, mostly by Dubois-Violette. Recently in 2014 there has been a
burst of interest in this topic with work of Iyama,Kato,Miyachi defining
the corresponding N-derived category. We shall begin the talk with simple
definitions of $N$ complexes and their homology groups. Then gradually we
will move to the paper of Iyama explaining derived category of
$N$-complexes.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
