Dear all,

                           Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : Emmanuel Kwame Essel
          University of Cape Coast, Ghana

Title   : Homogenization of quasilinear parabolic problems by the method
of Rothe and two scale convergence

Date    : 30th July, 2014 (Wednesday)

Time    : 11:30a.m. - 12:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall V, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
In this talk we consider a linear parabolic problem with time dependent
coefficients oscillating rapidly in the space variable. The existence and
uniqueness results are proved by using Rothe&#146;'s method combined with
the technique of two-scale convergence. Moreover, we derive a concrete
homogenization algorithm for giving a unique and computable approximation
of the solution.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
