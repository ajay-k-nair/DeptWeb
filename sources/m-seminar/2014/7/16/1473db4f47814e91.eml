Dear all,

                           Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : Subhojoy Gupta
          Caltech

Title   : Thurston-Teichmüller theory and the dynamics of grafting

Date    : 16th July, 2014 (Wednesday)

Time    : 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall III, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
Complex projective structures on a surface S arise in the
"complex-analytic" description of Teichmüller space. The operation of
grafting parametrizes the space P(S) of such structures, and yields paths
in Teichmüller space called "grafting rays". I shall introduce these, and
describe a result concerning their asymptotic behavior. This talk shall be
mostly expository.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
