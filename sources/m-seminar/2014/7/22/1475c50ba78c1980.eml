Title   : Mechanisation of Knot Theory

Abstract:
      Mechanisation of Mathematics refers to use of computers to generate
or check
proofs in Mathematics. It involves translation of relevant mathematical
theories from one
system of logic to another, to render these theories implementable in a
computer. This process is termed formalisation of mathematics. Two among
the many way of mechanising are:
(1) generating results using Automated Theorem Provers,
(2) Interactive theorem proving in a Proof Assistant which involves a
combination of user intervention and automation.

In the first part of this thesis, we reformulate the question of
equivalence of two Links in First Order Logic using Braid Groups. This is
achieved by developing a set of Axioms whose canonical model is the
Infinite Braid Group. This renders the problem of distinguishing Knots and
Links, amenable to implementation in First Order Logic based Automated
Theorem provers. We further state and prove results pertaining to Models of
Braid Axioms.

The second part of the thesis deals with formalising Knot Theory in Higher
Order Logic using the Isabelle Proof Assistant. We formulate equivalence of
Links in Higher Order Logic. We obtain a construction of Kauffman Bracket
in the Isabelle Proof Assistant. We further obtain a machine checked proof
of invariance of Kauffman Bracket.


All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
