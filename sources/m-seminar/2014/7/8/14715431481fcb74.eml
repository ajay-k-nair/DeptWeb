Dear all,

                           Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : Subhojoy Gupta
          Caltech

Title   : Holonomy fibers of complex projective structures

Date    : 17th July, 2014 (Thursday)

Time    : 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall III, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
As a sequel to the talk on July 16th, I shall talk about a recent result
(joint work with Shinpei Baba) concerning fibers of the holonomy map from
P(S) to the PSL(2,C) character variety. The proof involves some
three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry, and train-tracks.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
