Dear all,

                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : Prof. Krishna Maddaly
          IMSc

Title   : Statistics in the Anderson Model

Date    : 19th November, 2014 (Wednesday)

Time    : 2:00 - 3:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract
It was shown by Minami that the local statistics of eigenvalues in the
Anderson model is Poisson.  In this work with Peter Hislop we show that
for the Anderson model with higher rank perturbations, which includes the
dimer model, the statistics is Compound Poisson in general.  This result
is also valid for the random Schrodinger operator with i.i.d potentials.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
