Abstract:
 I will be giving a series of 8 talks on Braid Groups. Braids groups are a
family of groups that have an intuitive geometric representation in terms
of permutations of strands. They have a wide range of applications within
mathematics especially in Knot Theory, Cryptography and Quantum
Computing.
 The broad list of topics that would be covered during the course includes
braid groups and geometric braids, isomorphism between a braid group and a
 mapping class group of a disc with punctures, braids and knots, Markov's
theorem and its proof, braids and knot invariants, Dehornoy order on
braids.
 Prerequisite for the course includes basic groups theory and basic
algebraic topology.


Everyone is invited
