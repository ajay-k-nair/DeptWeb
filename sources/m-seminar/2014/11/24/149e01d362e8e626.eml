Title:  Optimal differentiation on arbitrary grids

Abstract:  Finite difference formulas approximate the derivatives of a
function given its values at a discrete set of grid points. Much of the
theory for choosing grid points is concerned with discretization errors
and rounding errors are ignored completely. However, when the grids become
fine the rounding errors dominate. Finding finite difference formulas
which optimize the total error leads to a combinatorial optimization
problem
with a large search space. In this talk, we will describe a random walk
based strategy for tackling the combinatorial optimization problem.

Title: An anti-concnetration inequality

Abstract: We give a quick overview of some recent developments (mostly of
others) in the study of zeros of random polynomials and a new
anti-concentration inequality that has been discovered in this context.
The goal will be to give a full proof of this inequality.
