 Abstract :

Generalised polygons are incidence structures that generalise
projective planes (generalised triangles) and are closely related to
finite groups. The Feit-Higman theorem states that any generalised
n-gon is either an ordinary polygon or n = 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 or 12.

The initial part of the proof by Feit and Higman is combinatorial and
the rest being analytical. We present a formal proof of the
combinatorial part in Agda - a dependently typed functional
programming language and proof assistant based on the intuitionistic
type theory by Per Martin-Löf
