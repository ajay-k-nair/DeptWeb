Title:  Brownian excursions into an interval

Abstract: The dynamics of excursions of Brownian motion into a set with
more than one boundary point , which no longer have the structure
of a Poisson process, requires an extension of Ito's excursion
theory , due to B.Maisonneuve. In this talk we provide a `bare hands'
calculation of the relevant objects - local time, excursion measure -
in the simple case of Brownian excursions
into an interval (a,b), without using the Maisonneuve theory.
We apply these computations to calculate
the asymptotic distribution of excursions into an interval, straddling
a fixed time t, as t  goes to infinity.

Title: Phase transitions in the pattern maximum likelihood problem and its
Bethe variant

Abstract: The pattern maximum likelihood (PML) estimate, introduced by
Orlitsky et al. (2004), is an estimate of an unknown underlying
probability distribution from n i.i.d. samples taken from the
distribution. It is known to perform better than the empirical frequency
estimate when the number of samples, n, is much smaller than the support
size of the unknown underlying distribution. The PML estimate
involves solving a difficult optimization problem over the set of all
probability mass functions (pmfs) of finite support. While investigating
the question of deciding when the PML estimate is a uniform
distribution, we encountered an interesting phase transition phenomenon in
the PML estimate: at a certain sharp threshold, the uniform distribution
goes from being a local maximum to being a local minimum
for the optimization problem in the estimate. The Bethe variant of the PML
estimate, based on the Bethe approximation method from statistical
physics, also exhibits an interesting phase transition behaviour.
In this talk, we will describe the phase transitions seen in the PML
estimate and its Bethe variant. All the necessary background and
definitions will be provided in the talk.

This is joint work with Winston Fernandes, Eric Chan and Manjunath
Krishnapur.
