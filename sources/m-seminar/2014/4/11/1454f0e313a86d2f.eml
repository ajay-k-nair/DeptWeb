Dear all,

                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : Dr. Lakshmi Lavanya

Title   : A Characterisation of the Fourier transform on the Heisenberg group

Date    : 11th April, 2014 (Friday)

Time    : 4:00 - 5:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
A recent theorem of S. Alesker, S. Artstein-Avidan and V. Milman
characterises the Fourier transform on R^n as essentially the only
transform on the space of tempered distributions which interchanges
convolutions and pointwise products. Analogously, we study the image of
the Schwartz space on the Heisenberg group under the Fourier transform and
obtain a similar characterisation for the Fourier transform on the
Heisenberg group.
This is a joint work with Prof. S. Thangavelu.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
