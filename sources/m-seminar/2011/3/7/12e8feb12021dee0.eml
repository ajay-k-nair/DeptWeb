                                  Abstract
                                 **********
I will present an overview of a new Calculus on fractal curves, which will
begin with defining a mass function on fractal curves. This mass function
will then be used to define new integrals and derivatives, namely the
$F^\alpha$-integral and differential operators. Thus after presenting a
newly developed Calculus for fractal curves, I will talk about a conjugacy
between this and Riemann Calculus which gives a method to evaluate 
$F^\alpha$ integral and derivatives for many simple cases. In the second
part of my talk, I will discuss and demonstate some Physical applications
of $F^\alpha$ Calculus. This will include Fokker-Planck Equation, Random
walk problems and the  Langevin approach on fractal curves. Some
interesting results obtained by exact or heuristic methods, regarding the
above Physical Applications will be presented.
