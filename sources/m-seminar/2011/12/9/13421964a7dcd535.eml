Title	: A nice group structure on certain orbit spaces of
 	  unimodular rows

Time	: 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 noon

Venue	: Department of Mathematics, Lecture Hall I

Abstract:
In this talk, we will begin with the definition of a unimodular row and
its relation to Serre's problem on projective modules. We will then see
under what conditions group structures exist on orbit spaces of
unimodular rows under elementary action.

Though the group structure is quite complicated in general, there is a
nice formula for the group structure in certain special cases like affine
algebras or polynomial rings. As a consequence of the nice group
structure, one can complete certain unimodular rows elementarily too.
The talk will be accessible to students.
