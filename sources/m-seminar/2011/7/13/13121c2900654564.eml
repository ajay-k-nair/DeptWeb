Dear All,

The Bangalore Probability Seminar is back!


 			  BANGALORE PROBABILITY SEMINAR
 				  July 13, 2011


SEMINAR 1

Speaker	: Prof. D. Yogeshwaran
 	  Ecole Normale Superieure - INRIA

Title	: Clustering, Percolation and directionally convex ordering
 		of point processes

Date	: July 13, 2011

Time	: 2:30-3:30 p.m.

Venue 	: Department of Mathematics

 	  Lecture Hall I

Abstract:
Heuristics indicate that point processes exhibiting clustering of points
have larger critical radii for the percolation of their continuum
percolation models than spatially homogeneous point processes. I will
explain why the dcx ordering of point processes is suitable to compare
their clustering tendencies. Hence, it is tempting to conjecture that
the critical radius is increasing in dcx order. We will prove the
conjecture for some non-standard critical radii; however it is false
for the standard critical radii. I will discuss the implications of
these results. A powerful implication is that point processes dcx-smaller
than a homogeneous Poisson point process admit uniformly non-degenerate
lower and upper bounds on their critical radii. In fact, all the above
results hold under weaker assumptions of ordering of moment measures and
void probabilities of the point processes. Examples of point processes
comparable to Poisson point processes in this weaker sense include
determinantal and permanental point processes with trace-class integral
kernels. Perturbed lattices are the most general examples of dcx sub- and
super-Poisson point processes. More generally, we show that point
processes dcx-smaller than a homogeneous Poisson point process exhibit
phase transitions in certain percolation models based on the level-sets
of additive shot-noise fields of these point process. Examples of such
models are k-percolation and SINR-percolation. This is a joint work with
Bartek Blaszczyszyn.


SEMINAR 2

Speaker : Prof. Subhroshekhar Ghosh

Title   : What does a point process outside a domain tell us about
 		what's inside?

Date    : July 13, 2011

Time    : 3:45-4:45 p.m.

Venue   : Department of Mathematics
 	  Indian Institute of Science
 	  Lecture Hall I

Abstract:
In a Poisson point process we have independence between disjoint spatial
domains, so the locations of the points outside a disk give us no
information on the points inside. The story gets a lot more interesting
for processes with stronger spatial correlation. In the case of Ginibre
ensemble, a process arising from eigenvalues of random matrices, we
prove that the outside points determine exactly the number of points inside,
and further, we demonstrate that they determine nothing more. In the
case of zero ensembles of a Gaussian power series, we prove that the
outside points determine exactly the number and the center of mass of
the inside points, and nothing further. These phenomena suggest a certain
hierarchy of point processes, where a higher order process is rigid with
respect to a greater variety perturbations. Poisson, Ginibre and the
Gaussian power series fit in at levels 0, 1 and 2 in this hierarchy.
