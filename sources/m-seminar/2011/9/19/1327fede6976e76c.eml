  				SEMINAR


Speaker	: Prof. Amritanshu Prasad
 	  IMSc, Chennai

Title	: Representations of Symmetric Groups via the RSK Correspondence

Date	: September 23, 2011

Time	: 4:00-5:00 p.m.

Venue	: Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics


Abstract:
I will explain how the purely combinatorial Robinson-Schensted-Knuth
correspondence can be used to give a simple proof of the classification
of irreducible representations of symmetric groups in the semisimple
case. It turns out that all the standard results in the representation
theory of symmetric groups can be recovered using this approach.
