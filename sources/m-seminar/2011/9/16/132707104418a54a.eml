Title	: Regularization by 1/2-Laplacian and
 	  Vanishing Viscosity Limit for HJB Equations

Date	: September 16, 2011

Time	: 4:00-5:00 p.m.

Venue	: Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
We investigate the regularizing effect of adding small fractional
Laplacian, with critical fractional exponent 1/2 , to a general first
order HJB equation. Our results include some regularity estimates for
the viscosity solutions of such perturbations, making the solutions
classically well-defined. Most importantly, we use these regularity
estimates to study the vanishing viscosity approximation to first
order HJB equations by 1/2-Laplacian and derive an explicit rate
of convergence for the vanishing viscosity limit.
