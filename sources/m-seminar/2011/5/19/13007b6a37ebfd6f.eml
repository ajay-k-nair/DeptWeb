Abstract:
Let G be the absolute Galois group of a field that contains a primitive
p-th root of unity. This is a profinite group which is a central object of
study in arithmetic algebraic geometry. In joint work with Ido Efrat and
Jan Minac, we have shown that a remarkably small quotient of this big
group determines the entire Galois cohomology of G. As application of this
result, we give new examples of profinite groups that are not realisable
as absolute Galois groups of fields. I will present an overview of
this work.
