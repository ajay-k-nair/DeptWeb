 				SEMINAR

Speaker	: Prof. Chandan Singh Dalawat
 	   HRI, Allahabad

Title	: Serre's mass formula in prime degree

Date	: January 19, 2011

Time	: 4:00-5:00 p.m.

Venue	: Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
Serre's mass formula counts the number of totally ramified degree-$n$
extensions $E$ of a local field $F$, each extension being assigned
some weight depending upon how ramified it is.  We will present an
elementary proof of this formula when the degree $n$ is prime. The
background material will be covered, so that the talk should be
accessible to a broad mathematical audience.
