  				SEMINAR


Speaker	: Prof. Siddhartha Gadgil
 	  IISc

Title	: The Goldman Bracket and Intersection Numbers II

Date	: August 17, 2011

Time	: 2:00-3:00 p.m.

Venue	: Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics


Abstract:
I shall give more details of the relation of intersections to
hyperbolic geometry and give a sketch of the proof of the main
theorem. I shall also outline to the relation of intersection numbers
to the so-called Hurwitz equivalence, and hence to smooth 4-manifolds.
