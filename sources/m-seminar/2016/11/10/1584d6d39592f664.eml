Title: Torelli theorem for the parabolic Deligne-Hitchin moduli space

 Abstract: The Deligne-Hitchin moduli space is a partial compactification
 of the moduli space of $\lambda$-connections. It includes as closed
 subvarieties the moduli spaces of Hitchin bundles ($\lambda=0$) and of
 holomorphic connections ($\lambda=1$), exhibiting the later as a
 deformation of the former. We show a Torelli theorem for a parabolic
version of this moduli space (joint work with David Alfaya). I will try to
make the talk accessible to a wide mathematical audience.
