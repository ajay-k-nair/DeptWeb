Title: Algebraic K and L-theory of groups acting on trees

Abstract: The Farrell-Jones Isomorphism conjecture gives a single
statement to understand many standard conjectures in Topology and Algebra=
.
We will discuss understanding K and L-theory of groups acting on trees
from the vertex stabilizers of the action, in the context of Isomorphism
conjecture.

Title: The isomorphism conjecture for Artin groups

Abstract: We will prove the Isomorphism conjecture for a class of Artin
groups and calculate the surgery L-groups of the corresponding pure Artin
groups.
