Subject: meeting this week

=========================================
Prof. Mohan Ravichandran (MSGSU, Turkey) is visiting for two weeks and will be giving the following talk on September 6 (Tuesday), 2-3 pm in Bhabha.

Title: Mixed Determinants, Restricted Invertibility and Kadison-Singer

Abstract: The solution of the Kadison-Singer problem by Marcus,
Spielman and Srivastava proceeded by first proving Weaver's KS_r
conjecture, which was known to imply Anderson's paving conjecture,
which in turn implies Kadison-Singer. In this talk, I'll explain how
the two celebrated innovations of MSS, the method of interlacing
polynomials and the multivariate barrier method can be used to prove
the paving conjecture directly without using Weaver's KS_r. The
relevant expected characteristic polynomials are then succinctly given
by expressions related to the so called Mixed determinant, in the same
way as the Mixed characteristic polynomial of MSS is related to the
mixed discriminant.

This slight change in perspective allows us to make some modest
improvements in the estimates in Kadison-Singer and restricted
invertibility. For instance, one can show that projections with
diagonal 1/2 can be 4 paved (it is expected that they can be 3 paved,
but this method breaks down in a curious fashion at the last step).
This new approach also yields some remarkable combinatorial results,
including a natural, hitherto undiscovered one parameter deformation
of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix and a new convolution on
polynomials, (distinct from the three convolutions introduced by MSS

in 2015) that preserves real rootedness.Â
