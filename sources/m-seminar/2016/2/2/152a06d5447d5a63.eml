Dear All,

  Speaker:  Athanase Papadopolous
            Universite de Strasbourg

  Title:  Funk and Hilbert geometry: Euclidean, non-Euclidean and timelike

  Date and Time: 4th February, 12 AM - 1 PM

  Venue: LH3 Math Dept IISc

  Abstract: I will present the Funk and Hilbert metrics on convex sets in
the setting of Euclidean, non-Euclidean and timelike geometries. I will
explain the motivation for studying these metrics and highlight some of
their main properties, concerning geodesics, infinitesima structures and
isometries.



Best Regards
Harish
