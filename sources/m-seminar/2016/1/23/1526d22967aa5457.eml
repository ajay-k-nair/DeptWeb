Dear All,

There will be two lectures in the "Eigenfunctions" seminar series on 29th 
Jan, 2015.

--------------------------------------------
Lecture 1:

Speaker: Kalyan B Sinha (JNCSAR, Bangalore and IMI Distinguished 
Associate)

Title: Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors, Eigenfunctions,  Everywhere!

Time and date: 2:15-3:15 PM, 29th jan

Venue: LH-1, department of mathematics

Abstract: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors  appear in many physical and 
engineering problems , beginning with the  noted  study by Euler in 1751 
of the kinematics of rigid bodies . From a mathematical point of view, 
for an operator  of a suitable class, acting in a vector space, its point 
spectrum and associated subspaces refer to its  "eigenvalues and 
eigenvectors", while the subspaces associated with the continuous 
spectrum of the operator is said to consist of "eigenfunctions".  The 
basic ideas will be discussed mostly thru examples, in some of which  a 
natural connection  with the representation of appropriate groups lurk 
behind.

------------------------------
Lecture 2:

Speaker: Svante Linusson (KTH, Stockholm)

Title: Electoral methods and the probability of the Alabama paradox

Time and date: 3:30-4:30 PM, 29th Jan

Venue: LH-1, department of mathematics

Abstract:  There exists various possible methods to distribute seats 
proportionally between states (or parties) in a parliament. In the first 
half of the talk I will describe some often used methods and discuss their 
pros and cons (it's all in the rounding).

One easy method is called Hamilton's method (also known as the method of 
largest reminder or Hare's method). It suffers from a drawback called the 
Alabama paradox, which e.g made USA abandon it for the distribution of 
seats in the house of representatives between states. It is still in use 
in many other countries including Sweden.

In the second half of the talk I will describe a joint work with Svante 
Janson (Uppsala Univ.) where we study the probability that the Alabama 
paradox will happen. We give, under certain assumptions, a closed formula 
for the probability that the Alabama paradox occurs given the vector 
$p_1,\dots,p_m$ of relative sizes of the states.
