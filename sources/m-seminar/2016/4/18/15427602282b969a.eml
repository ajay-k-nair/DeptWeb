Title: Unique factorization of tensor products for finite-dimensional
simple Lie algebras

Abstract: Suppose V is a finite dimensional representation of a complex
finite dimensional simple Lie algebra that can be written as a tensor
product of irreducible representations. A theorem of C.S. Rajan states
that the non-trivial irreducible factors that occur in the tensor product
factorization of V are uniquely determined, up to reordering, by the
isomorphism class of V. I will present an elementary proof of Rajan's
theorem. This is a joint work with S.Viswanath.
