       Dear All,

       Please join us for SAMOSe (Simons Assorted Math Open Seminar) on Friday.
       Details below:

       Date & Time: Friday, October 28 at 4pm (Tea/Coffee at 3:45pm)

       Venue: Simons Centre, Ground Floor.

       Speaker: Sandeep Krishna, NCBS.

       Title: The Perron-Frobenius theorem and its application to a class of
       dynamical
       systems

       Abstract:
       The Perron-Frobenius theorem is a powerful and useful result about the
       eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a non-negative matrix. I will not be
       proving the theorem but will instead focus on its applications. In
       particular, I will discuss how it can be used to understand the behaviour
       of a certain class of dynamical systems, namely certain systems of
       first-order ordinary differential equations where the couplings between
       variables are specified by a graph. Some familiarity with graph theory will
       be useful, but I will try to recapitulate all the basic concepts needed for
       this talk.
