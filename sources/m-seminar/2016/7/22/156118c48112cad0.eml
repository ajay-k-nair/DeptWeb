Dear all,

                           Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : Swarnava Mukhopadhyay
          University of Maryland

Title   : Rank-level duality of Conformal Blocks

Date    : July 25th, 2016

Time    : 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
Classical invariants for representations of one Lie group can often be
related to invariants of some other Lie group. Physics suggests that the
right objects to consider for these questions are certain refinements of
classical invariants known as conformal blocks. Conformal blocks appear in
algebraic geometry as spaces of global sections of line bundles on the
moduli stack of parabolic bundles on a smooth curve. Rank-level duality
connects a conformal block associated to one Lie algebra to a conformal
block for a different Lie algebra.

In this talk, we will first discuss  rank-level duality for the pair
orthogonal and spin groups on the projective line and then for the pair
(G_2, F_4) over a smooth curve of genus g. If time permits, we will
discuss  rank-level duality for odd orthogonal groups over curves of
positive genus.  The later is joint with Richard Wentworth.


All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
