          SEMINAR

   DEPARTMENT  OF  MATHEMATICS

----------------------------------------------------------

Speaker: Ajay Ramadoss, Indiana University

Title: Representation homology

Date: 26 July 2016

Time: 11:00 a.m.

Venue: LH-1, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:

The n-dimensional matrix representations of a group or an associative
algebra  A form a space (algebraic variety) Rep(A,n) called the n-th
representation  variety of A. This is a classical geometric invariant that
plays a role in many areas of mathematics. The construction of Rep(A,n) is
natural (functorial) in A, but it is not `exact' in the sense of
homological algebra. In this talk, we will
explain how to refine Rep(A,n) by constructing a derived representation
variety DRep(A,n), which is an example of a derived moduli space in
algebraic geometry. For an application, we will look at the classical
varieties of commuting matrices, and present a series of combinatorial
conjectures extending the famous Macdonald conjectures in representation
theory.
