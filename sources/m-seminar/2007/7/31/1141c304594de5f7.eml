    Abstract:
 	A family of elliptic curves (or an elliptic surface) is given by a 
Weierstrass equation

 	E_t : y^2= x^3+ A(t)x + B(t),

where A(t) and B(t) are polynomials. Little is known about the rational points 
on such families. However there are interesting predictions. For example, a 
conjecture of Mazur states that if one fiber E_t has infinite number of 
rational points, then there is a dense set of fibers with infinite number of 
rational points. In the special case when deg A<= 4 and deg B<= 6, there is a 
more precise conjecture of Manin about the number of rational points of a fixed 
height. In this talk I will describe recent results towards these conjectures. 
I will also discuss other open problems regarding distribution of Mordell-Weil 
ranks.


                      All  interested  are  Welcome

                                                     CHAIRMAN
