Abstract:
 	Calcium waves are an important means of intrcellular signaling. 
Intracellular calcium release at the endoplasmatic reticulum is a prime example 
of the role of stochastic effects in cellular systems. Realistic models consist 
of deterministic systems of reaction-diffusion equations in three dimensional 
space coupled to stochastic transitions of calcium channels at the domain 
boundary. The resulting dynamics has multiple time and space scales, which 
complicates computer simulations. In this talk we focus on the PDE aspect of 
the numerical computations.  We use adaptive linear finite elements to 
efficiently resolve the extreme spatial gradients of concentration variables 
close to a channel. Further, parallel computing is needed for realistic 
simulations. We describe the algorithmic approach and we demonstrate its 
efficiency by computational examples. Our single channel model matches 
experimental data by Mak et al. (PNAS 95, 1998) and results in intriguing 
dynamics if calcium is used as a carrier. Random openings of the channel 
accumulate in bursts of calcium blips that may prove central for the 
understanding of cellular calcium dynamics. We plan to extend our computations 
to more realistic domain geometries and to use local time stepping methods.
