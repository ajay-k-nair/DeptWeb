Abstract:
 	Calcium waves are an important means of intrcellular signaling. 
Intracellular calcium release at the endoplasmatic reticulum is a prime 
example of the role of stochastic effects in cellular systems. Realistic 
models consist of deterministic systems of reaction-diffusion equations in 
three dimensional space coupled to stochastic transitions of calcium 
channels at the domain boundary. The resulting dynamics has multiple time 
and space scales, which complicates computer simulations. In this talk we 
focus on the PDE aspect of the numerical computations.  We use adaptive 
linear finite elements to efficiently resolve the extreme spatial 
gradients of concentration variables close to a channel. Further, parallel 
computing is needed for realistic simulations. We describe the algorithmic 
approach and we demonstrate its efficiency by computational examples. Our 
single channel model matches experimental data by Mak et al. (PNAS 95, 
1998) and results in intriguing dynamics if calcium is used as a carrier. 
Random openings of the channel accumulate in bursts of calcium blips that 
may prove central for the understanding of cellular calcium dynamics. We 
plan to extend our computations to more realistic domain geometries and to 
use local time stepping methods.
