Abstract:
 	Informally, the ``zero-range'' particle system follows a 
collection of dependent random walks on a lattice, each of which interacts 
infinitesimally only with those particles already present at its location.
 	In this talk, we consider the asymptotics of a distinguished, or 
tagged particle in this interacting particle system.  In particular, we 
discuss a ``nonequilibrium'' invariance principle, in one dimension when 
the transition rates are mean-zero, with respect to a diffusion whose 
coefficients depend on the ``hydrodynamic'' density.


                      All  interested  are  Welcome

                                                             CHAIRMAN
