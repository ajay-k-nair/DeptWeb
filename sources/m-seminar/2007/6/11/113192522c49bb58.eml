Abstract:
 	A central result used in studying higher linking of knots is a theorem 
of Stalling on lower central series. Stallings's proof was based on spectral 
sequences, but he indicated that the result can be proved directly using Hopf's 
description of homology of groups. In this talk Stallings theorem will be 
explained and a direct proof will be presented.
