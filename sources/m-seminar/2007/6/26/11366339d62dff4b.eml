Abstract:
 	We discuss a conjecture for the Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity 
(degree) of a homogeneous ideal in a polynomial ring over a field. 
Herzog-Huneke-Srinivasan conjectured that the multiplicity can be bounded 
by a function of the maximum twists occuring at different homological 
degrees in a minimal graded free resolution of the ideal. We will discuss 
some examples and some cases where the conjecture is known to hold.

                      All  interested  are  Welcome

                                                             CHAIRMAN
