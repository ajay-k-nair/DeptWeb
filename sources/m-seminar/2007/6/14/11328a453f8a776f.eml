Abstract:
    	We consider the simplest models of Hermitian and non Hermitian
random matrices with independent and identically distributed entries. We
present basic results on limiting spectral distributions (Wigner's
semicircle law in the Hermitian case and Girko's circular law in the
non Hermitian case).

                                                             CHAIRMAN
