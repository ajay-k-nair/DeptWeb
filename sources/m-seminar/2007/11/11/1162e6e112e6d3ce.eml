Abstract:
 	The spectral Pick-interpolation problem, i.e. to determine when 
there exists a holomorphic map from the unit disc to the class of complex 
matrices of spectral radius less than one that interpolates prescribed 
data, has a complicated solution using operator-theory and control-theory 
methods. The difficulty in implementing this solution motivated a new 
approach pioneered by Agler and Young. Their methods led to a checkable 
necessary condition for Pick interpolation. But, from a complex-geometric 
viewpoint, it was unclear why the latter condition should be sufficient. 
In this talk, we will demonstrate that this condition is not sufficient. 
We will also present an inequality -- largely linear-algebraic in flavour 
-- that provides a necessary condition for matricial data for which the 
Agler-Young-type test provides no conclusions.

                      All  interested  are  Welcome

                                                     CHAIRMAN
