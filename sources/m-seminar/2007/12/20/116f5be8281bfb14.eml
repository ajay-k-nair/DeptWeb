Abstract:
 	We show that Trepreau's theorem (minimality of a hypersurface at a 
point implies one sided extension of all CR functions) does not hold if the 
hypersurface is allowed to have singularities. We formulate a geometric 
condition called two sided support which is the obstruction to such extension.
