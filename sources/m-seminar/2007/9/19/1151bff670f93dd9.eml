Abstract:
 	Typical adaptive mesh-refining algorithms for first-oder 
(conforming) finite element methods consist of a sequence of the following 
steps:

\[ \mbox{SOLVE }\Rightarrow \mbox{ ESTIMATE }\Rightarrow \mbox{ 
MARK } \Rightarrow \mbox{ COARSEN/REFINE } \]

Unlike uniform mesh-refinements, the goal of adaptive finite element 
methods (AFEM) is to omit some basis functions in oder to save degrees of 
freedom and so reduce computational costs. Thus, the sequence of generated 
subspaces in an AFEM is on purpose {\em not} necessarily dense and hence 
the question of strong convergence has a~priori {\em no} trivial 
affirmative answer. Moreover, it is well-known, that the convergence rates 
even of uniform finiteelement schemes may be arbitrarily poor.

This presentation gives a survey conditions on known convergence results
for a class of adaptive finite element methods applied to a linear
elliptic benchmark problem, nonstandard finite element methods,  to
convex minimization problems such as an optimal design task.

                      All  interested  are  Welcome

                                                     CHAIRMAN
