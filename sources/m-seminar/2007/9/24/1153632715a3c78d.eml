Abstract:
 	Starting with a brief description of classical cryptography
and the need for quantum cryptography, I will elaborate on some of the
mathematical questions within quantum cryptography, ending with the
details on a a particular problem - the construction of mutually
unbiased basis.

The talk may be of interest to algebraists, cryptographers and design
theorists as well as functional analysts as there are open problems in
each of these.
                      All  interested  are  Welcome

                                                     CHAIRMAN
