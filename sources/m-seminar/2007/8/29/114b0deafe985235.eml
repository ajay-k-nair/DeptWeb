Abstract:
 	The notion of modular symbols was first introduced by Manin.
We state some basic results which relate modular symbols to special values
of L-functions and p-adic L-functions.  We give Greenberg and Stevens
construction of an overconvergent modular symbols which is a measure
valued cohomology class attached to a Hida family of modular forms with
certain interpolation properties.  We will construct the Mazur-Kitagawa
two variable p-adic L-function from the overconvergent modular symbol.
