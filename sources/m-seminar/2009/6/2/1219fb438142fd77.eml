                                 **********

The effect of curvature on the behaviour of solutions of the heat equation
on a Riemannian manifold is a classical problem. A quantitative
measurement of this behaviour is encoded most directly in terms of
gradient estimates and Harnack inequalities involving constants depending
only on lower Ricci curvature bounds and the dimension of the manifold. In
this series of lectures we explain how probabilistic methods can be used
to establish gradient bounds for heat equations. We deal in particular
with localized versions of such estimates (linear and nonlinear) and show
that Brownian motion on a Riemannian manifold may serve as a unifying
tool. The talk is based on joined work with Marc Arnaudon, Bruce Driver
and Feng-Yu Wang.
