Abstract:
        Let $V$ be finite dimensional vector space
over the field of complex numbers. Let $G$ be a finite
subgroup of $GL(V)$, group of all $\bc$- linear
automorphisms of $V$. Then, the apmple generator of the
Picard group of the projective space $\bP(V)$ descends to
the quotient variety $\bP(V)/G$. Let $L$ denote the descent.
We prove that the polarised variety $\bP(V)/G, L$ is
projectively normal when $G$ is solvable or $G$ is
generated by pseudo reflections.

We also prove that an arithmetic result of
Erd\{o}s-Ginzburg-Ziv is equivalent to our result
when $G$ is cyclic.
