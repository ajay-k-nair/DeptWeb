    Title                : Size biasing with applications to Markov chains

Abstract:
      If X is a positive random variable with a finite mean then the
probability distribution with density proprtional to X is called its size
biased version. For Markov chains admitting a positive eigen
function one can construct a size biased version of this chain which is
also Markov.. In this talk we derive conditions for the two
chains to be dominated by each other over the full trajectory
space.. We then apply this to derive a LLOGL result for
supercritical branching processes with arbitrary type space.
