                                    Abstract

I will give a reasonably detailed exposition of results describing
Kobayashi-hyperbolic manifolds for which the dimension of the group of
holomorphic automorphisms is "sufficiently high". The classification
problem for hyperbolic manifolds with high-dimensional automorphism group
can be thought of as a complex-geometric analogue of that for Riemannian
manifolds with high-dimensional isometry group, which inspired many
results in the 1950's-70's. Although the methods presented here are almost
entirely different from those utilized in the Riemannian case, there is a
common property that made these classifications possible: both the action
of the holomorphic automorphism group of a hyperbolic manifold and the
action of the isometry group of a Riemannian manifold are proper on the
respective manifolds. The properness of the action will be central to our
exposition.
