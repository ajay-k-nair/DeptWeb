                                     Abstract

(Geometry and Analysis in Siegel’s Universe)
What is a multi-dimensional analysis? There is a straight forward way to
apply one-dimensional analysis to each of several variables, but it is
much more interesting to explore “irreducible” possibilities. One of most
successful realizations goes back to Siegel, who considered the “matrix
line” of symmetric matrices. We build step-by-step geometry of matrices –
analogues of half-lines, segments, projective geometry, quadrics,
complexifications, discs, half-planes, Cayley transform, conformal
geometry etc. Simultaneously, we develop matrix analogues of analytic
objects – Euler integrals, derivatives and antiderivatives,
Riemann-Liouville integrals (fractional derivatives), Cauchy integral
formulas, residues, etc. We will discuss also some generalizations in a
context of analysis on symmetric spaces.
