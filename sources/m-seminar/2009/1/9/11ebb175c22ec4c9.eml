                                    Abstract
The aim of this series of five lectures is to give brief glimpses into the
tremendous strides made in various streams of the theory of Operator
Algebras that have blossomed into essentially independent realms of
specialisation. An attempt will be made to convey the common flavour of
non-commutativity or quantisation (as it is often referred to) that
underlies these themes.

 The five lectures will be on:
 (1) C*-algebras: the Gelfand Naimark theorems
 (2) K-theory of C*-algebras
 (3) von Neumann algebras
 (4) II_1 factors and their subfactors
 (5) The Jones polynomial invariant of knots

These topics may be regarded as non-commutative analogues of point-set
topology, algebraic topology, measure theory, and an application to knot
theory. After building up the necessary background, this course will
culminate in the derivation of the polynomial invariant of knots obtained
by Jones, who was awarded the coveted Fields’ Medal in 1990 primarily for
this work.
