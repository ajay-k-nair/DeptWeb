Abstract:
       Clifford analysis is a higher dimensional analogue of single
variable complex analysis. Although functions take values in a
finite dimensional Clifford algebra, the representation formula for
Clifford regular functions is simpler and more powerful than for
holomorphic functions of several complex variables. The talk shows
how Clifford analysis techniques can be employed in operator theory
for a functional calculus of $n$-tuples of operators.

           All are Welcome.
                                              Chairman
