                                   Abstract
We will concentrate on two cases when the complex Monge-Ampère equation is
used in Kähler geometry: in Yau’s proof of the Calabi conjecture (where
one solves an inhomogeneous version of this equation on a compact manifold
without boundary)and in the Donaldson problem of existence of geodesics in
the Mabuchi space of Kähler metrics (which is equivalent to solving the
homogeneous equation with prescribed boundary values). In the beginning,
we will review basic concepts of Kähler geometry as well as the continuity
method which reduces solving nonlinear elliptic equations of second order
to a priori estimates.
