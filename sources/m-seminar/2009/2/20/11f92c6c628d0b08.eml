Abstract:
 	We consider a system coupling the Stokes system with an elastic
structure modelled by a finite dimensional system. We prove that this 
system can be driven to zero by a control action only in the
fluid equation. The proof is based on a global Carleman inequality. 
Because of the coupling between the fluid equation and the
structure new boundary terms appear in the Carleman inequality, and 
estimating these terms requires new techniques.

                      All  interested  are  Welcome

                                                     CHAIRMAN
