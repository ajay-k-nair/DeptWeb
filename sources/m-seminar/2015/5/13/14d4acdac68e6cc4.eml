Title: Non-vanishing of Dirichlet L-functions in Galois orbits

Speaker : Rizwanur Khan

Time: June 12, 2015 ( 3-4 PM)

Place : LH 1

Abstract: A well known result of Iwaniec and Sarnak states that for at
least one third of the primitive Dirichlet characters modulo q (where q is
any sufficiently large integer), the associated L-functions do not vanish
at the central point. When q is a large power of a fixed prime, we prove
the same proportion when we restrict to characters of any given order. The
set of primitive Dirichlet characters modulo q of a given order can be
described as an orbit under the action of a Galois group.
