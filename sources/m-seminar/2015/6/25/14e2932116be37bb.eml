Dear All,


DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS
IISc., BANGALORE - 12


Speaker : Dr. Ridhdi Shah

Title   : Dynamics of Distal Group Actions

Date    : June 25, 2014

Time    : 3:00-4:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall 1, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
An automorphism T of a locally compact group is said to be distal if the
closure of the T-orbit of any nontrivial element stays away from the
identity. We discuss some properties of distal actions on groups. We will
also relate distal groups with behaviour of powers of probability measures
on it.


                       All are welcome!
