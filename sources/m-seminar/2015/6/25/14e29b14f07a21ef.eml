Title: Some computational and analytic aspects of Chern-Weil forms

Abstract: This talk will focus on two aspects of vector bundles. One is
the calculation and application of certain characteristic and secondary
characteristic forms (i.e. Chern, Chern-Simons, and Bott-Chern forms).
This part is joint work with Leon Takhtajan and Indranil Biswas. The
second is to study certain fully nonlinear PDE akin to the Monge-Amp\'ere
equation arising from these differential geometric objects. An existence
result or two will be presented along with the difficulties involved in
the PDE. Moreover, other areas of geometry and physics from which the same
PDE arise will be pointed out.
