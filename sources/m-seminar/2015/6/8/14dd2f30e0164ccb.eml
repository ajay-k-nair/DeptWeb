Abstract:  Abstract  : In this work, we study certain stability results
for Ball
Separationproperties in
Banach Spaces leading to a discussion in the context of operator spaces.
In this  work, we
study certain stability results for Small Combination of  Slices Property
(SCSP) leading to a
discussion on SCSP in the context of operator spaces. SCSpoints were first
introduced as a
"slice generalisation" of the PC  (i.e. point ofcontinuity  points  for
which the identity mapping
from weak topology to normtopology is continuous.) It is known that X is
strongly regular
respectively X*is w*-strongly regular) if  and  only  if  every   non
empty  bounded convex  set
K in X ( respectively  K in X*) is contained in the norm closure (
respectively          w*-
closure)of SCS(K)( respectively w*-SCS(K)) i.e. the SCS points ( w*- SCS
points) of K.
Later, it was proved that a Banach space has Radon- Nikodym  Property
(RNP) if and only if
it is strongly regular and it has the Krein-Milamn  Property(KMP).
Subsequently, the concepts
of SCS points was used to investigate the structure of non-dentable closed
bounded convex
sets  in  Banach spaces. The "point version" of the result   was also
shown to be true .
