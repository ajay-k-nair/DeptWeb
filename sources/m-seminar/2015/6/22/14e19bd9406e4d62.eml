Title: Electrostatic skeletons

Speaker: Koushik Ramachandran (ISI, Bengaluru)

Date: June 24

Time and venue: 3-4 PM, LH-1, department of mathematics

Abstract: Let P be the equilibrium potential of a compact set K in R^n. An
electrostatic skeleton of K is a positive measure µ such that the closed
support S of µ has connected complement and empty interior, and the
Newtonian (or logarithmic, when n = 2) potential of µ is equal to P
near infinity. We prove the existence and uniqueness of an electrostatic
skeleton for any simplex.
