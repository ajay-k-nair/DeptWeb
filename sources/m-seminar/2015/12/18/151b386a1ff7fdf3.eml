> Title: Asymptotically accurate and stable Runge-Kutta schemes for the
> wave equation system in the low Mach Number limit.

Abstract: We
> consider a wave equation system with advection as a simple linearised
> model of the compressible Euler equation of gas dynamics. It is well
> known that the solutions of the compressible Euler equations in a
> low-mach number regime are good approximations of the solutions of the
> incompressible Euler equations. Due to this asymptotic convergence,
> numerical schemes designed only for the compressible equations suffer
> from several pathologies: reduction of order, lack of stability,
> inconsistency etc. In the present work, we consider a framework for
> analysing the above three difficulties by taking the wave equation
> with advection as a prototype model. Guided by a systematic multiscale
> asymptotic expansion, we split the fluxes into so called stiff and
> non-stiff parts. The non-stiff part is so designed that its Jacobian
> matrix always has finite eigenvalues, facilitating the use of standard
> upwind discretising procedures. On the other hand, the stiff part
> constitutes a wave equation system with very large wave speeds. We use
> an implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge-Kutta scheme for discretisation,
> therein the non-stiff part is treated explicitly and the stiff part
> implicitly. The key idea behind the loss of accuracy of compressible
> flow-solvers in low mach numbers is due to their inability to preserve
> a so-called well-prepared space of spatially constant densities and
> divergence free velocity fields. In the light of this, we prove that
> both our first and second order IMEX schemes preserve the well
> prepared space and hence they do not suffer from any inaccuracies when
> the Mach number goes to zero. We perform a stability analysis of the
> proposed schemes and show that the schemes are stable under ususal CFL
> like conditions which are solely dictated by the finite eigenvalues of
> the non-stiff fluxes. In addition, we also show that with an
> appropriate choice of a splitting parameter the numerical scheme is
> consistent with the limit equations even in the low mach number limit.
