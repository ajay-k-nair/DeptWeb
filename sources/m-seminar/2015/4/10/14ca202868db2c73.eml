Lecture I:

Title: Linearity in perceptual space

Speaker: S. P. Arun

Abstract:
    Our vision is unsurpassed by machines because we use a sophisticated
object representation. This representation is unlike the retinal
image: on the one hand, two out-of-phase checkerboards, maximally
different in image pixels, appear perceptually similar. On the other
hand, two faces, similar in their image pixels, appear perceptually
distinct. What is then the nature of perceptual space? Are there
principles governing its organization? To address these questions, we
have been using visual search to measure similarity relations between
objects.
    I will summarize a line of research from our laboratory indicative of
a surprising linear rule governing distances in perceptual space. In
the first study, we found that search time is inversely proportional
to the feature difference between the target and distracters. The
reciprocal of search time is therefore linear and interestingly, it
behaved like a mathematical distance metric. It also has a
straightforward interpretation as a saliency signal that drives visual
search (Arun, 2012). In a second study, complex searches involving
multiple distracters were explained by a linear sum of pair-wise
dissimilarities measured from simpler searches involving homogeneous
distracters (Vighneshvel & Arun, 2013). In a third study,
dissimilarities between objects differing in multiple features were
found to combine linearly. This was also true for integral features
such as the length and width of a rectangle upon including aspect
ratio as an additional feature (Pramod & Arun, 2014). Finally, I will
describe some recent results extending these findings to more
naturalistic objects.

Lecture II:

Title: Visual search as active sequential testing

Speaker: Rajesh Sundaresan

Abstract:
    Arun and Olson (2010) conducted a visual search experiment where human
subjects were asked to identify, as quickly as possible, an oddball
image embedded among multiple distractor images. The reciprocal of the
search times for identifying the oddball (in humans) and an ad hoc
neuronal dissimilarity index, computed from measured neuronal
responses to component images (in macaques), showed a remarkable
correlation. In this talk, I will describe a model, an active
sequential hypothesis testing model, for visual search. The analysis
of this model will suggest a natural alternative neuronal
dissimilarity index. The correlation between the reciprocal of the
search times and the new dissimilarity index continues to be equally
high, and has the advantage of being firmly grounded in decision
theory. I will end the talk by discussing the many gaps and challenges
in our modeling and statistical analysis of visual search. The talk
will be based on ongoing work with Nidhin Koshy Vaidhiyan (ECE) and S.
P. Arun (CNS).
