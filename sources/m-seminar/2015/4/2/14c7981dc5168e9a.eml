Title   : Achieving positive information velocity in wireless networks

Date    : 6th April, 2015 (Monday)

Time    : 2:00 - 3:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract: In wireless networks, where each node transmits independently of
other nodes in the network (the ALOHA protocol), the expected delay
experienced by a packet until it is successfully received at any other
node is known to be infinite for signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio
(SINR) model with node locations distributed according to a Poisson point
process. Consequently, the information velocity, defined as the limit of
the ratio of the distance to the destination and the time taken for a
packet to successfully reach the destination over multiple hops, is zero,
as the distance tends to infinity. A nearest neighbor distance based power
control policy is proposed to show that the expected delay required for a
packet to be successfully received at the nearest
neighbor can be made finite. Moreover, the information velocity is also
shown to be non-zero with the proposed power control policy. The condition
under which these results hold does not depend on the intensity of the
underlying Poisson point process.

Title   : Normal convergence of geometric functionals of clustering point
processes

Date    : 6th April, 2015 (Monday)

Time    : 3:15 - 4:15 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract: I shall describe a central limit theorem for geometric
functionals on point processes satisfying a "clustering condition".
Examples of geometric functionals of interest are subgraph and component
counts in a random geometric graph, intrinsic volumes of a Boolean model.
Non-trivial examples of point process that satisfy our requirements are
zeros of Gaussian analytic functions and determinantal point
processes. In some particular cases, I shall describe variance asymptotics
which are also necessary for the central limit theorem. This is a joint
work with Joseph Yukich and Bartek Blaszczyszyn.
