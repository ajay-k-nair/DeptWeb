Title: Algorithms and complexity for Turaev-Viro invariants

Speaker: Jonathan Spreer, The University of Queensland, Australia

Date: Nov 13

Time: 4 pm

Location: LH-1

Abstract: The Turaev-Viro invariants are a powerful family of topological
invariants
for distinguishing between different 3-manifolds. They are invaluable for
mathematical software, but current algorithms to compute them require
exponential
time. I will discuss this family of invariants, and present an explicit
fixed-parameter
tractable algorithm for arbitrary r which is practical---and indeed
preferable---to the
prior state of the art for real computation.
