Dear all,

                           Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : Jerome Bertrand
          Université Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France

Title   : Prescribing Gauss curvature using mass transport

Date    : 25th February, 2015 (Wednesday)

Time    : 3:30 p.m. - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
In this talk, I will give a proof of Alexandrov’s theorem on the Gauss
curvature prescription of Euclidean convex body. The proof is mainly based
on mass transport. In particular, it doesn’t rely on pdes method nor
convex polyhedra theory. To proceed, I will discuss generalizations of
well-known results for the quadratic cost to the case of a cost function
which assumes infinite value.


All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
