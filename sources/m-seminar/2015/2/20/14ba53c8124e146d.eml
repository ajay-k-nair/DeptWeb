Dear All,

    We shall have the first pair of lectures for the semester in the
eigenfunctions series.

Speaker: Arvind Ayyer

Title: The dimer model and generalisations

Date: Friday, February 20, 2015.

Time: Lecture I: 2:15 - 3:15 p.m.
      Coffee break: 3:15 p.m. - 3:30 p.m.
      Lecture II: 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.
      High Tea: 4:30 p.m.

Venue: LH-I, Department of Mathematics, IISc.

Abstract:
        In the first half of the talk, I will define the dimer model on
planar graphs and prove Kasteleyn's groundbreaking result
expressing the
partition function (i.e. the generating function) of the model as a
Pfaffian. I will then survey various results arising as a consequence,
culminating in the beautiful limit shape theorems of Kenyon, Okounkov and
coworkers.

In the second half, I will define a variant of the monomer-dimer model on
planar graphs and prove that the partition function of this model can be
expressed as a determinant. I will use this result to calculate various
quantities of interest to statistical physicists and end with some open
questions.
