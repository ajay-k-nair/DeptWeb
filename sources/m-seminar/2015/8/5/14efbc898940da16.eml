Title: Operads: An Introduction.

Abstract:   An operad is an algebraic device which encodes a type of
algebra. The
classical types of algebras, ie. associative, commutative and Lie
algebras give the first examples of algebraic operads. Operadic point
of view has several advantages. Firstly, many results known for
classical algebras, when written out in operadic language, can be
applied to other types of algebras. Secondly, operadic language
simplifies the statements and proofs. Thirdly, even for classical
cases, operad theory has provided new results. We start with several
equivalent definitions, together with examples, and  few basic
properties.
