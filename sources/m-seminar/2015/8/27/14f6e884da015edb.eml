Title: Contact Structures and Contact Invariants in Heegaard Floer Homology.

Abstract: There is a dichotomy of contact structures-- tight vs
overtwisted. Classification of overtwisted contact structures up to
isotopy, due to Eliashberg, is well understood. However, there have been
few results towards classification of tight contact structures. In
general, given a contact structure it is difficult to know whether it is
tight or not.

In this talk, we focus on the role of certain element, called as contact
invariant, of Heegaard Floer homology groups associated with a given
contact structure in understanding tightness. We discuss success and
limitations of contact invariant in detecting tightness of contact
structures. In this direction, I will also present a recent result from
joint work with James Conway and Amey Kaloti.

In the first half of the talk, we will start from basics. Next, we will
survey important results from Contact Topology and Heegaard Floer Homology
relevant for the purpose of this talk. So, the first half will be
accessible to wide audience.
