Title: Dual pairs and intertwining distributions

Abstract: A reductive dual pair in the group Sp(W) of isometries of a
symplectic space W, over a local

field of characteristic not 2, is a pair of subgroups G, G0 of Sp(W) which
act reductively on

W and are centralizers of each others. In the 70ies, Roger Howe made (and
later proved over

the reals; for p-adics with p odd it was done by Jean-Loup Walsburger and
for p = 2 by Wee

Teck Gan this year) the conjecture that for any reductive dual pair G, G0

a one-to-one correspondence of irreducible admissible representations of
the lifts of G and G0

inside a certain two-fold covering group of Sp(W), the metaplectic group.
The main problem,

still open, is to understand this correspondence. Many different
approaches have been used

to describe Howe’s correspondence by means of objects associated with
representations, such

as Langlands parameters, orbits, characters or infinitesimal characters.

The so-called intertwining distributions are special tempered
distributions on the symplectic

space W which are naturally linked to pairs of representations occurring
in Howe’s corre-
spondence over the reals. They are a tool to understand this
correspondence at the level of

characters. We shall explain this in the case where the group G is
compact. This is a joint

work with Mark McKee and Tomasz Przebinda.
