Title: Eigenvalues of sparse regular random graphs

Abstract: Adjacency matrices of sparse random regular graphs are long
conjectured to lie within the universality class of random matrices. However,
there are few rigorously known results. We focus on fluctuations of linear
eigenvalue statistics of a stochastic process of such adjacency matrices
growing in dimension. The idea is to compare with eigenvalues of minors of
Wigner matrices whose fluctuation converges to the Gaussian Free Field. We
show that linear eigenvalue statistics can be described by a family of Yule
processes with immigration. Certain key features of the Free Field emerge as
the degree tends to infinity. Based on joint work with Tobias Johnson.

        All are cordially invited.
