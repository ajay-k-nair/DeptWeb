Dear all,

In the Geometry Topology informal seminars, Dr. Micah Miller will give his
third talk on the following topic on Thursday (1 November) at 2.30 pm
in LH I.

Title: An introduction to spectral sequences

Abstract:  Over the course of two or three talks, we introduce the concept
of spectral sequence and describe some applications.  In the first talk,
we will construct a spectral sequence associated to a filtered chain
complex. The Leray-Serre spectral sequence and Zeeman spectral sequence
arise in this way.

The rest of the talks will discuss applications of these two spectral
sequences.  We will use the Serre spectral sequence to do a few
computations and show how to derive the Gysin exact sequence.  We will use
the Zeeman spectral sequence to study the failure of a space to satisfy
Poincare duality.

The only prerequisite needed is the definition of a chain complex and its
homology.

                 All are cordially invited.
