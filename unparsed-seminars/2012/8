Dear All,
        Here are more details of my impromptu talk:
                                                 Siddhartha

Title: We know all 3-manifolds (following
...,Thurston,...,Perelman,...Wise, Agol)
Venue: LH -III
Time :11:30 a.m., Wed. March 28 (today)
Description:
        We now have a simple description of 3-manifolds due to various
breakthrough results, including a brand new one of Ian Agol. I will
give this description. The talk will assume only basics of manifolds
and covering spaces.
