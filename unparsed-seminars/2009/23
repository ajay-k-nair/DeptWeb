TITLE: Overdetermined multidimensional systems and dilation theory for
pairs of commuting contractions

ABSTRACT: I will give an overview of a long ongoing work with Joe Ball on
spectral analysis and dilation theory for pairs of commuting contractions.
It is well known that the usual model theory for a single contraction can
be understood by embedding the contraction into a conservative
input/state/output system and studying the space of finite-enegy
trajectories (the associated scattering system in the sense of
Lax--Phillips and Adamyan--Arov). The characteristic function of the
contractio! n is the transfer function of the input/state/output system
(or the scattering function of the scattering system). It turns out that a
similar approach can be carried out in the multivariable situation,
leading to overdetermined conservative input/state/output systems,
multievolution scattering systems, and characteristic/transfer/scattering
functions which are mappings of vector bundles on a compact real Riemann
surface.
