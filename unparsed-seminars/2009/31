                                  Abstract
We derive a Hamiltonian formalism for a wide class of mechanical systems
that includes, as particular cases, classical Hamiltonian systems,
non-holonomic systems, some classes of servomechanisms... This
construction strongly relies on the geometry characterizing the different
systems. The main result of this paper is to show how the general
construction of the Hamiltonian symplectic formalism in classical
mechanics remains essentially unchanged starting from the more general
framework of algebroids.Algebroids are, roughly speaking, vector bundles
equipped with a bilinear bracket of sections and two vector bundle
morphisms (the anchors maps) satisfying a Leibniz-type property. The
bilinear bracket is not, in general, skew symmetric and it does not
satisfy, in general, the Jacobi identity. Since skew-symmetry is related
with preservation of the Hamiltonian, our Hamiltonian framework also
covers some examples of dissipative systems. On the other hand, since the
Jacobi identity is related with the preservation of the associated linear
Poisson structure, then our formalism also admits a Hamiltonian
description for systems which do not preserve this Poisson structure, like
nonholonomic systems. Some examples of interest will be considered:
gradient extension of dynamical systems, non holonomic mechanics and
generalized nonholonomic mechanics, showing the applicability.
