                                 TITLE/ABSTRACT
LECTURE-1: Bornological vector spaces

The notions of topological and bornological vector space are two different
ways to generalise the notion of a normed space to cover more
examples.While topological vector spaces are more common, the bornological
ones are often easier to work with and have, in general, better algebraic
properties.  We briefly discuss the definition and some basic properties
of and constructions with bornological vector spaces, among them
completions and tensor products.  Then we introduce some basic homological
algebra for modules over bornological algebras.


LECTURE-2: The Schwartz space of R as a module over its multiplicative group

Let S(G) for an Abelian group G denote the space of Schwartz functions on
G.  The multiplicative group R* of the field R of real numbers acts on the
Schwartz space S(R) by scaling.  We can restrict this action to a discrete
subgroup exp(Za) of R* and ask about the coinvariant space, that is, the
quotient space of S(R) by the relation that identifies f with gf for g in
exp(Za).  Similar but slightly more complicated questions arise in an
adelic construction of a spectral interpretation for zeros of L-functions.

We compute the coinvariant space of S(R) in two ways, using extensions of
modules.  The first approach splits S(R) into the subspace of Schwartz
functions with vanishing Taylor series at 0 and the space of formal power
series.  The other approach decomposes S(R) into variants of the Schwartz
algebra S(R*) weighted by characters.  The latter approach is more
complicated but also more useful in connection with L-functions because it
mimicks the proof of meromorphic extension of L-functions using the
Poisson summation formula.


LECTURE-3: A spectral interpretation for zeros of the zeta function

I describe the construction of a spectral interpretation of the zeros of
the Riemann zeta function following Alain Connes and use this to establish
the explicit formula as a trace formula.  This means that I construct an
operator (on a nuclear Frechet space) whose spectrum consists of the zeros
of the zeta function, each occurring with correct multiplicity.  This
operator integrates to a representation of the group R, which in turns
integrates to a representation of the convolution algebra of test
functions on R.  The latter algebra is represented by nuclear operators,
and its trace can be computed in two different ways. This establishes the
explicit formula relating zeros of the zeta function to the distribution
of prime numbers.

To keep this lecture simple, I avoid the more general construction for
L-functions of number fields, which uses adeles and ideles, and limit the
construction to the zeta function, which is reasonably elementary. The
main ingredient is the Schwartz space S(R) and certain convolution
operators on it.


LECTURE-4: Isocohomological subalgebras

Given a dense subalgebra A in a bornological algebra B, it is desirable to
know whether homological invariants for B-modules (extension and torsion
spaces) change when we view them as A-modules.  We call A an
isocohomological subalgebra of B if these homological invariants are the
same on both sides in a sufficiently strong sense.  This situation occurs
frequently but not always.  We first discuss some examples where A is the
group algebra of Z and B are the weighted Schwartz algebras from the
previous lecture.  This case was, in fact, already used in he previous
lecture.  Then we move on to other completions of group algebras for
discrete groups.  Here we use techniques from geometric group theory to
establish that the ell-Schwartz algebra of a discrete group is
isocohomological if the group is combable.  If time permits, I will also
briefly discuss a similar result for Harish-Chandra-Schwartz algebras of
reductive p-adic groups.
