Abstract:
In the traditional mathematical approach to quantum field theory,
the basic ingredients are quantum fields as an (unbounded)
operator-valued distribution satisfying standard axioms, which
provides a unitary representation of the Poincare group (coming
from the special theory of relativity) with particle spectrum,
the commutativity of observables at space-like distance and the
positivity of the energy operator (the generator of the time
translation). The operator algebra approach is to replace concrete
fields by an operator algebra ${\mathcal A}({\mathcal O})$ for each
finite space-time region ${\mathcal O}$.

In the first lecture, it will be explained how to develop the
scattering theory without having a concrete field.

In the second lecture, we will turn to a specific mathematical
aspect found in the study of operator algebras associated with a
(general) quantum field in a wedge shaped region of the Minkowski
space-time. It is the connection of their modular operator and the
modular conjugation operator with kinematical transformations. It
shows how a deep mathematical structure is contained in quantum
field theory if we watch it carefully.
