Dear All,


     Title: Embedded Contact Homology II, and Rounding corners of
            polygonal paths

   Speaker: Dr. Eli Lebow
            NCBS, Bangalore.

   Time and Date:  4 to 5 PM, 11th April (Friday)

     Venue: LH-3


Abstract:

    This talk consists of two parts, one a wrap-up of last week's talk, and
one nearly independent.

   We finish up the definition of ECH given in last week's talk, specifying
the differential \delta in terms of pseudoholomorphic curves in
Y x R, after recalling some of the context.

   Then, we define a chain complex of labeled polygonal paths, with a
differential given by ``rounding corners.''  This is a self-contained
concept, though it is motivated by the fact that the polygonal-path chain
complex has homology isomorphic to the ECH of hyperbolic T^2 bundles over
S^1.

   Most of the material in this talk is from Hutchings and Sullivan
(``Rounding corners of polygons and the embedded contact homology of
T^3'', Geometry and Topology, 2006).
