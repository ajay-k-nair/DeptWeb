                                 Abstract

The central question will be focused around the design and implementation
of neuronal circuitry involved in the task of decoding sensory
information. Sensory information is encoded in the form of sequence of
action potential spikes by the peripheral nervous system. This information
is then passed onto the central nervous system (CNS) to generate an
appropriate response. The action potential spikes are identical in shape
and therefore it is assumed that all the information about the environment
is embedded in the timing of occurrences of these spikes. The question
then is, what neural architecture exists in the CNS to decode this
information?

I will present a novel neuronal architecture designed specifically for the
task of temporal spike pattern recognition. I will begin with a brief
introduction to the mathematical field of Neurodynamics, the goal of which
is to understand the dynamical principles underlying the functioning of
the brain. I will then describe the key ingredients of the proposed
architecture for spike pattern recognition, which we refer to as the
Interspike Recognition Unit. I will describe the learning mechanism that
this circuit adopts to train itself for the specific goal of spike pattern
recognition. I will summarize my talk by discussing the importance of
mathematical modeling in Neuroscience.
