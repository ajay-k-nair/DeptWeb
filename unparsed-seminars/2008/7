                                  Abstract
                                 ------------

           In this mini-course I will give a short introduction
           to embedded CR manifolds and discuss the problem of
           holomorphic extension of CR functions from hypersurfaces.
           I will also discuss possible generalizations of this
           problem to singular hypersurfaces.
