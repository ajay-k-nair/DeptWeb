Dear All,

  There will be a series of three lectures next week , the details are
as follows:


   Speaker: Prof. Zindine Djadli

   Title:  Some recent progress in conformal geometry

   Venue: LH 1 , IISc Maths Dept

   Time: 4-5 PM  on 28th, 29th and 30th (Tue, Wed and Thur)

Abstract : In my lectures I will describe some recent works in
conformal geometry. Starting with the basic example of surfaces, we
will see how we can generalize some of the results for surfaces to
higher dimensional manifolds. We will emphasize the importance of
geometric partial differential operators and their associated
invariants in order to do so.


Best Regards

Harish Seshadri
