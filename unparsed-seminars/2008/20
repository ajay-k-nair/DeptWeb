                                   Abstract

Very large datasets occur in the area of machine learning (ML). The tasks
are having a computer "learn" to read handwriting, to understand speech,
to recognize faces, to filter spam e-mail etc. Mathematically, these
problems lead to huge optimization problems, of an, however not
unfavorable type, namely convex quadratic programs (QP).

The talk starts with an introduction to the Support Vector Machine methods
for ML and their mathematical characteristics. Three specific such
algorithms are described, the SVM light algorithm, the SVM-QP method, and
the Core-SVM approximation method. A comparison on several large datasets
is given. Future work will concentrate on the SVM-QP method in
collaboration with its author Katya Scheinberg, IBM Watson Research
Center.
