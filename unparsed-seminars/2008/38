Abstract
---------
The aim of this presentation is to highlight some recent advances on the
mathematical analysis and the control of self-propelled motions of solids
in a fluid. We study a model consisting in a solid undergoing an
undulatory deformation, which is immersed in a viscous incompressible
fluid. The motion of the fluid is governed by the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations and the standard conservations laws of linear and
angular momentum rule the dynamics of the structure. The time variation of
the fluid domain (due to the motion of the structure) is not known a
priori, so we deal with a free boundary value problem. The displacement of
the solid is decomposed into a rigid part and a deformation (undulatory)
part. The rigid part of the displacement results from the interaction of
the fluid and the solid, whereas the deformation part is given. Since our
aim is to possibly consider several immersed solids, the domain filled by
the fluid is one of the unknowns. Therefore we have to tackle a free
boundary value problem. The solutions are controlled by an input which is
the shape of the solid.
We first show that the initial and boundary value problem obtained by
coupling the Navier-Stokes equations for the fluid to Newtons law for the
creature is well-posed in Sobolev type spaces. We next give an
approximation scheme for the governing equations which is tested on some
undulatory motions observed by the zoologists in order to get
straight-line-swimming or turning. We finally tackle, from a control
theoretic perspective the swimming of aquatic microorganisms. Since, the
Reynolds number is this time very low, we consider a model based on the
Stokes equations for the fluid. This presentation is  essentially based on
results from [1] and [2].
