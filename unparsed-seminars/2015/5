Dear all,

                            Department of Mathematics
                     Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                     SEMINAR


Date: Thursday (Nov 5) 3pm.

Venue: LH-1, Department of mathematics

Speaker: Raphael Chetrite (Universite Nice Sophia Antipolis)

Title : Nonequilibrium Markov processes conditioned on large deviations

Abstract : I will present a general approach for constructing a Markov
process that describes the dynamics of a nonequilibrium process when one or
more observables of this process are observed to fluctuate in time away from
their typical values.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
