Title: Bounds for L-functions

Venue: LH 1 Department of Mathematics IISC

Time and Date: 4-5 PM 20Th April 2011 (Wednesday)

  Abstract: L-functions play a central role in Analytic Number Theory.
Obtaining upper bounds for these functions inside the critical strip is an
important problem with several applications. From the functional equation
one can derive the trivial bound (i.e. the convexity bound), which just
fails to be good enough in many applications. In this talk I will focus on
this problem and discuss some of the results in this direction.
