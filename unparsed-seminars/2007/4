                             Abstract
                           ------------
I will describe how ideas and methods from the theories of deterministic
and stochastic dynamical systems can be used to model and analyze the
behaviors of running and thinking animals (including humans). I will show
that simple energy-conserving mechanical models possess stable gaits
similar to those seen in rapid running from insects to humans, and those
realistic models of neural pattern generators and muscles can be added to
such models, allowing the study of neural feedback. I will also show that
one dimensional drift-diffusion processes can describe the accumulation of
evidence in cortical areas during decision making. This permits explicit
analyses of optimal decision strategies, to which human and animal
behaviors can be compared. Throughout, I will emphasise how simple models
can help reveal the dynamics of complex phenomena, and even provide
partial explanations of them.

Background can be found in two extensive review articles:

P. Holmes, R.J. Full, D. Koditschek and J. Guckenheimer. The dynamics of
legged locomotion: Models,  analyses, and challenges. SIAM Review 48(2):
207-304, 2006.}
R. Bogacz, E. Shea-Brown, J. Moehlis, P. Holmes and J.D. Cohen. The
physics of optimal decision making: A formal analysis of models of
performance in two-alternative forced choice tasks. Psychological.
