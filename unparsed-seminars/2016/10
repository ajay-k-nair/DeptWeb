Title : Determining the Optimal Policy for the Stochastic Control Formulation of Feedback Capacity

Speaker : Navin Kashyap (IISc, Bangalore)

Time and Date : 2.15 PM, 1st February 2016 ( Monday) 

Venue : LH-1, Math. Dept., IISc.

Abstract:   The feedback capacity of a channel is the maximum rate at which 
reliable communication is possible across the channel, when the transmitter has
access to feedback from the receiver. Here, by feedback, we mean that at each 
(discrete) time instant, the transmitter gets to see the channel output from the 
transmission in the previous time instant. A classical theorem of Shannon states
that feedback cannot increase the capacity of a discrete memoryless channel. 
However, when the channel has memory, feedback may increase capacity. The
feedback capacity serves as a useful upper bound on the capacity without feedback. 
 For a broad class of channels, the feedback capacity can be formulated as the 
optimum reward in an average-reward stochastic control problem, and therefore,
it is possible to numerically estimate it using dynamic programming. In certain 
rare cases, the Bellman equation of the dynamic program can be exactly solved, 
which yields an explicit expression for feedback capacity. In this talk, we follow 
this approach to obtain exact expressions for the feedback capacity of certain 
binary-input channels, where the channel inputs are constrained to be binary 
sequences in which consecutive 1s are disallowed. The solution to the Bellman 
equation here also provides us with the optimal policy for the stochastic control 
problem, which in turn results in simple coding schemes for achieving the 
feedback capacity.

This is joint work with Oron Sabag and Haim Permuter (Ben-Gurion University, Israel).

Title:  Extreme value statistics (near extreme events and records)

Speaker : Sanjib Sabhapandit ( RRI, Bangalore.)

Time and Date : 3.30 PM, 1st February 2016 ( Monday) 

Venue : LH-1, Math. Dept., IISc.

Abstract:

I will discuss the extreme value statistics and about the events occur with
their values near the extreme. I will present our recent results on the
near-extreme events where we provide a quantitative analysis of the phenomenon of crowding of
near-extreme events by computing exactly the density of states (DOS) near 
the maximum of a set of independent and identically distributed random variables. 
I will finally discuss results on the statistics of records for a time series generated by continuous time random walk.
