Title: Module approach to operator theory

Speaker: Jaydeb Sarkar (ISI, Bengaluru)

Location : LH-1

Time: 4pm


Abstract: We will begin by briefly describing some of the reasons to be
interested in Hilbert module approach to operator theory. Then we will
review some recent results and developments in function theory and
(multivariable) operator theory. Along the way, we will discuss a list of
examples and (wild) conjectures. The talk is intended for general
audience.
