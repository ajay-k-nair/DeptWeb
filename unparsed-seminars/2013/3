Dear all,


Date & time:      Dec 12-13, 9:00am - 6:00pm
                  Dec 14, 9:00am - 4:00pm

Venue:            LH-I, department of Mathematics.

Abstract:

This workshop will consist of a series of one-hour lectures spanning a
broad range of topics of current interest in statistical modeling, data
analysis and inference in Bioinformatics. A wide range of topics of
current use and interest in bioinformatics and more generally for
biological data will be presented. These include methods for analysis of
micro array data, modeling for dynamics of mixtures, methods for
differential methylation using next generation sequencing data, methods
for analysis of gene networks and modeling and inference for circadian and
directional data. The workshop will also touch on themes to be further
developed during the SAMSI 2014-15 Beyond Bioinformatics research
program (www.samsi.info/bioinformatics).


Organizers:

Indian Institute of Science (IISc), India,
Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), India and
Statistical and MathematicalSciences Institute (SAMSI), USA

All are cordially invited.

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics.
