There are two different aspects to course listings: the <a href="#details">course details</a> and <a href="#schedule">courses offered by semester</a>. We first look at course details.

<h2 id="details">Course Details</h2>

<p>
The coures in the catalogue form a <em>collection</em>, with one source file for each courses. These are the files in the <a href="https://github.com/siddhartha-gadgil/DeptWeb/tree/841aef95fdd0a790fde35afb9e2e052492f30bf8/_all-courses" target="_blank">_all-courses</a> folder. By convention, these have names of the form <code>ma123.md</code> for a course with code "123".
</p>

<p>
A typical course file is as below (you may want to see this in <strong>raw</strong> form).
</p>
{% gist dd29b66b04154afbf356db75f1cfa949 %}

<p>
  The top-matter, i.e, the part between the lines with just three hyphens, should include the course code, title and references and prerequisites as appropriate. Note that this is formatted by indentation (i.e., spaces), so ensure that spacing is as in the above example.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> You must include a course code - if it is not available, use a placeholder. Courses are sorted by their codes in the catalogue, so the site will not compile if a course file has no code.
</p>

<p>
For each course file, the information is automatically included in the catalogue and a separate page is created for each course. If you wish to edit the catalogues layout, you should edit its <a href="https://github.com/siddhartha-gadgil/DeptWeb/blob/841aef95fdd0a790fde35afb9e2e052492f30bf8/catalogue.html" target="_blank">source</a>, which is as below.
</p>
{% gist c96879285dd6ffc398f2ecfba5932a9e %}

<p>
The separate pages for the courses are based on the <a href="https://github.com/siddhartha-gadgil/DeptWeb/blob/841aef95fdd0a790fde35afb9e2e052492f30bf8/_layouts/course.html" target="_blank">course layout</a>. This is as below.
</p>

<h2 id="schedule">Courses offered by semester</h2>

<p>Details of courses offered by semester are in the YAML data file <a href="https://github.com/siddhartha-gadgil/DeptWeb/blob/841aef95fdd0a790fde35afb9e2e052492f30bf8/_data/courses.yaml" target="_blank">courses.yaml</a>. An extract from this is as below.
</p>
{% gist 0952df67472dc78e01c54b2e65063b2f %}

<strong>Note:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>This is grouped by semester.</li>
  <li>Within each semester, courses are further grouped as <em>core1</em>, <em>core2</em> and <em>electives</em>.</li>
  <li>If there is a webpage for that specific semester, this should be given as the website. Otherwise the course description page is linked.</li>
  <li>If credits are not specified, they are taken as "3:0".</li>
</ul>

<p>
This data is rendered according to the <a href="https://github.com/siddhartha-gadgil/DeptWeb/blob/841aef95fdd0a790fde35afb9e2e052492f30bf8/course-list.html" target="_blank">course-list</a> source file as <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/course-list.html" target="_blank"> current and upcoming</a> courses.
