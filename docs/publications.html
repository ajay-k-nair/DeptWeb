title: "Docs: Publication"

<p>
Publications are displayed in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/pubs.html" target="_blank">Publications page</a> only, but the data processing is more complicated than other cases, so is outlined below (as is the code for the publications page).
</p>
<h3>Data and pre-processing</h3>

<p>
The publications page uses the YAML data file <a href="https://github.com/siddhartha-gadgil/DeptWeb/blob/master/_data/pubs.yaml" target="_blank">pubs.yaml</a>, but this is <strong>not</strong> supposed to be directly edited. Instead it is generated by a script from two sources:
<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://github.com/siddhartha-gadgil/DeptWeb/blob/master/_data/publications.bib" target="_blank">publications.bib</a> : this is a BibTeX file generated from MathSciNet primarily by searching by Institution "6-IIS" </li>
  <li> <a href="https://github.com/siddhartha-gadgil/DeptWeb/blob/master/_data/extrapubs.yaml" target="_blank">extrapubs.yaml</a> : this has publications that are for whatever reason not (yet) on MathSciNet. We see some details of this below.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The BibTeX file is translated to yaml and combined with the extra-pubs file by the custom script <a href="https://github.com/siddhartha-gadgil/DeptWeb/blob/master/bib2yaml.sc" target="_blank">bib2yaml</a>. This is a scala script based on the <a href="http://ammonite.io/" target="_blank">Ammonite REPL</a>. This has to be run from the base directory of the repository after updated a source file.
</p>

<h4>The extrapubs file</h4>

<p>Below is an extract from the <code>extrapubs.yaml</code> file, which is in the yaml format.</p>

<p>
Each publication has a separate entry beginning with a hyphen, with all fields directly below the first (i.e., the format is based on indentation). The order of the fields does not matter.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Warning:</strong> The colon has a special meaning, so if an entry has a colon, enclose it in quotation marks.
</p>

<h3>The publications page</h3>

<p>
The publications page itself has the <a href="https://github.com/siddhartha-gadgil/DeptWeb/blob/master/pubs.html" target="_blank">source</a> file as below. Edit this to show how publications are rendered. This shows the publications for the latest 15 years by year sorted alphabetically, and then the earlier publications.
