### Abstracts

#### Lecture 1 ​

__Speaker:__ _Uri Onn_ (Australian National University, Canberra, Australia)

__Title:__ ​ Representation growth of arithmetic lattices

__Abstract:__ Let $G$ be a group and let $r(n,G)$ denote the number of equivalence classes of $n$-dimensional complex irreducible representations of $G$. Representation growth is a branch of asymptotic group theory that studies the asymptotic and arithmetic properties of the sequences $(r(n,G))$. In 2008 Larsen and Lubotzky conjectured that all irreducible lattices in a high rank semisimple Lie group have the same degree of polynomial representation growth. In this talk I will explain the conjecture and describe the ideas around the proof of a variant of the conjecture: if the lattices have polynomial representation growth (which is known to be true in most cases) then they have the same degree of polynomial growth. This is a joint work with Nir Avni, Benjamin Klopsch and Christopher Voll.

__Speaker:__ _Shaunak Deo_ (TIFR, Mumbai)

__Title:__ Deformations of Galois representations

__Abstract:__ One of the main themes of deformation theory of Galois representations is to study families of Galois representations obtained by interpolating various Galois representations having certain prescribed properties. In this talk, I will first review some basic facts and results of deformation theory of Galois representations. Then I will describe the basic anatomy of theorems comparing various universal deformation rings with appropriate Hecke algebras (which are popularly known as 'R=T' theorems in the literature and are important from Number theoretic point of view). In the second half of the talk, I will describe some of my own results in which establishing an R=T theorem has played a crucial role.

#### Lecture 5​

__Speaker:__ _Amalendu Krishna_ (TIFR, Mumbai)

__Title:__ An application of $K$-theory in class field theory

__Abstract:__ I will show how we can use algebraic $K$-theory to solve a higher dimensional class field theory problem. Time permitting, I will give an application to the solution of a conjecture of Deligne on $\ell$-adic local systems.
