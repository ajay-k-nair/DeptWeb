__Abstract:__ I present details of three disparate projects that received
funding from the Infosys Foundation. The first is the
[Polymath-14 project](http://michaelnielsen.org/polymath1/index.php?title=Linear_norm),
which arose out of a discussion literally made possible by Infosys funding!
In this project, we show that a group is abelian and torsion-free if and
only if it admits a "norm", or equivalently a homogeneous length function.
This question was motivated by probability, connects algebra, geometry,
and analysis, was solved in five days on a blog, and used a computer.
([Joint work as D.H.J. Polymath](http://dx.doi.org/10.2140/ant.2018.12.1773),
with Tobias Fritz, Siddhartha Gadgil, Pace Nielsen, Lior Silberman, and Terence Tao.)

The second project provides two-way connections between positivity (analysis)
and symmetric functions (algebra). I cover two aspects, the first of which
reveals that every smooth function naturally leads to all Schur polynomials.
This extends a computation by Loewner (1967). The "reverse" connection starts
from a Schur positivity/monotonicity phenomenon, and uses the
Harish-Chandra--Itzykson--Zuber integral to obtain a novel characterization
of weak majorization. This last is [joint with Terence Tao](http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05197).

Finally, I discuss recent
[joint work with Projesh Nath Choudhury](http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11566),
in which we study distance matrices of trees. We propose a model
that subsumes all previous variants to date (starting with Graham, Pollak,
and Lovasz). In this model, we compute the determinant, cofactor-sum, and
inverse of the distance matrix (and its minors), once again subsuming prior
results, and answering an open question of Bapat et al. The proofs use
Zariski density, as our results hold over all unital commutative rings.
