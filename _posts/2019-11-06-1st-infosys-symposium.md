__Title:__ Interpolation or the lack of thereof from affine hypersurfaces; a vector bundle version of the Monge-Ampere equation

__Abstract:__ There are two themes of my research funded by the Infosys Foundation. I shall present a "typical representative" of each theme.

1) PDE arising from Differential Geometry and Physics : The Monge-Ampere equation is a well-studied PDE in complex geometry and its solvability has ramifications in various sub-areas. Inspired by its success, in [a preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03934), I introduced a vector bundle version of it, and proved a Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence (essentially, the PDE has a solution if and only if some condition from algebraic geometry is met) in a special case, namely, for some equivariant rank-2 vortex bundles.

2) Analytic studies in Algebraic Geometry : A natural question arising from applied mathematics is, "When can one extend finite-energy analytic functions from subsets of `$\mathbb{C}^n$` to all of space whilst preserving the finite-energy condition ?" In a [joint work with D. Varolin](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00895), we discuss examples and counterexamples of such subsets arising as zeroes of polynomials.

__Title:__ ​ Groups with norms; Schur polynomials and weak majorization; distance matrices and Zariski density

__Abstract:__ I present details of three disparate projects that received
funding from the Infosys Foundation. The first is the
[Polymath-14 project](http://michaelnielsen.org/polymath1/index.php?title=Linear_norm),
which arose out of a discussion literally made possible by Infosys funding!
In this project, we show that a group is abelian and torsion-free if and
only if it admits a "norm", or equivalently a homogeneous length function.
This question was motivated by probability, connects algebra, geometry,
and analysis, was solved in five days on a blog, and used a computer.
([Joint work as D.H.J. Polymath](http://dx.doi.org/10.2140/ant.2018.12.1773),
with Tobias Fritz, Siddhartha Gadgil, Pace Nielsen, Lior Silberman, and Terence Tao.)

The second project provides two-way connections between positivity (analysis)
and symmetric functions (algebra). I cover two aspects, the first of which
reveals that every smooth function naturally leads to all Schur polynomials.
This extends a computation by Loewner (1967). The "reverse" connection starts
from a Schur positivity/monotonicity phenomenon, and uses the
Harish-Chandra--Itzykson--Zuber integral to obtain a novel characterization
of weak majorization. This last is
[joint work with Terence Tao](http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05197).

Finally, I discuss recent
[joint work with Projesh Nath Choudhury](http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11566),
in which we study distance matrices of trees. We propose a model that subsumes
all previous variants to date (starting with Graham, Pollak, and Lovasz). In
this model, we compute the determinant, cofactor-sum, and inverse of the
distance matrix (and its minors), subsuming prior results, and answering an
open question of Bapat et al. The proofs use Zariski density, as our results
hold over all unital commutative rings.
