title: "Homogeneous dynamics and number theory"
venue: "Department of Mathematics, Lecture Hall 1"

I will discuss some instances of the interplay between dynamics
on homogeneous spaces of algebraic groups and Diophantine approximation,
with an emphasis on recent developments. The latter includes joint work
with Gorodnik and Nevo, and with Einsiedler and Lytle.
