We will trace the evolution of the mean ergodic theorem, from its
original formulation by von-Neumann to some very recent formulations valid in
the context of algebraic groups and their lattice subgroups. We will then
present a variety of recent applications of mean ergodic theorems,
particularly to counting lattice points.
