The curvature of a contraction T in the Cowen-Douglas
class is bounded above by the curvature of the backward shift
operator. However, in general, an operator satisfying the
curvature inequality need not be contractive. In this talk we
characterize a slightly smaller class of contractions using a
stronger form of the curvature inequality.  Along the way, we find
conditions on the metric of the holomorphic Hermitian vector
bundle E corresponding to the operator T in the Cowen-Douglas
class which ensures negative definiteness of the curvature
function. We obtain a generalization for commuting tuples of
operators in the Cowen-Douglas class.
