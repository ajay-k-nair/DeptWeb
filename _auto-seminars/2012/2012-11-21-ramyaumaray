Grothendieck published an extraordinary paper entitled Resume de la

theorie metrique des produits tensoriels topologiques in 1953. The main

result of this paper is the inequality which is commonly known as

Grothendieck Inequality. Following Kirivine, in this article, we give the

proof of Grothendieck Inequality. We reformulate it in different forms. We

also investigate the famous Grothendieck constant KG. The Grothendieck

constant was achieved by taking supremum over a special class of matrices.

But our attempt will be to investigate it, considering a smaller class of

matrices, namely only the positive definite matrices in this class.
