Let R be an integral domain such that every non-zero quotient R/mR is
finite. Consider the unitaries and isometries on \\ell^{2}(R) induced
by the addition and the multiplication operation of the ring R. The
C*-algebra generated by these unitaries and isometries is called
the ring C*-algebra and was studied by Cuntz and Li.
