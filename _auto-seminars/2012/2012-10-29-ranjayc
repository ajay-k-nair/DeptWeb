We characterize the higher order Riesz transforms on the Heisenberg group and
also show that they satisfy dimension-free bounds under some assumptions on
the multipliers. We also prove the boundedness of the higher order Riesz
transforms associated to the Hermite operator. Using transference
theorems, we deduce boundedness theorems
for Riesz transforms on the reduced Heisenberg group and hence also for
the Riesz transforms associated to special Hermite and Laguerre
expansions.
