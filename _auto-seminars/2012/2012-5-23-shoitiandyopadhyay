title: "The role of potential theory in complex dynamics"
venue: "Department of Mathematics, Lecture Hall I"

Potential theory is the name given to the broad field of analysis
encompassing such topics as harmonic and subharmonic functions,
the Dirichlet problem, Green's functions, potentials and capacity.
We wish to gain a deeper understanding of complex dynamics using the
tools and techniques of potential theory, and we will restrict
ourselves to the iteration of holomorphic polynomials.
