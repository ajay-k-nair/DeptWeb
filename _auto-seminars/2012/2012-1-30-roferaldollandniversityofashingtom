The operators $f(t) \rightarrow f(t-a)$ and
$f(t) \rightarrow e^{2\pi bt} f(t)$ on $L^2(\mathbb R)$ generate unitary
representations of the discrete Heisenberg group $H$ with central
character $e^{2\pi abz}$. What are the irreducible representations
of $H$ with this central character, and how can one synthesize the
representation just described from them ? When $ab$ is rational, the
answers are quite straightforward, but when $ab$ is irrational
things are much more complicated. We shall describe results in both
cases.
