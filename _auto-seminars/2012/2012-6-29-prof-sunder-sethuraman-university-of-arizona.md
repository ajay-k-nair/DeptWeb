We derive a form of the KPZ equation, which
governs the fluctuations of a class of interface heights,
in terms of a martingale problem, as the scaling limit of
fluctuation fields with respect to some particle systems
such as zero range processes. This is joint work in
progress with P. Goncalves and M. Jara.
