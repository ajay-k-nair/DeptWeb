In this talk we will discuss some of the impact of Subramanian
Chandrasekhar's work on modern applied mathematics.
One of the highlight of the talk will be a discussion of Chandrasekhar's
radiative transfer theory where he developed a number of
breathtaking mathematical structures such as nonlinear integral equations
for the Chandrasekhar H functions and X, Y functions as well as
infinite dimensional Riccati (integro-partial differential differential )
equations for the scattering matrix long before the infinite dimensional
systems theory.
