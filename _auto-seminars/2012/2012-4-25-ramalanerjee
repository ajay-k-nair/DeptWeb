Recently, the financial world witnessed a series of major defaults by
several institutions and banks. Therefore, it is not at all surprising
that credit risk analysis has turned out to be one of the most important
aspects of study in the finance community. As credit derivatives are long
term instruments, they are affected by the changes in the market

cyclical effects of the market. This thesis addresses some of the
important issues in credit risk analysis for a regime-switching market.
