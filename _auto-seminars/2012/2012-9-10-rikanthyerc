Credit risk refers to the potential losses that can arise due to
the changes in the credit quality of financial instruments. There are two
approaches to pricing credit derivatives, namely the structural and the
reduced form or intensity based models.  In the structural approach
explicit assumptions are made about the dynamics of a firm's assets, its
capital structure, debt and share holders. A firm defaults when its asset
value reaches a certain lower threshold, defined endogenously within the
model. In the intensity based approach the firm's asset values and its
capital structure are not modelled at all. Instead the dynamics of default
are exogenously given through a default rate or intensity.
