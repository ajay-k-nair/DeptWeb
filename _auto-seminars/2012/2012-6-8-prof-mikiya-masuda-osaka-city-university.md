A simplicial cell complex is roughly speaking a CW complex whose cells
are all simplices. This notion is equivalent to that of simplicial
poset in combinatorics. A simplicial complex is a simplicial cell
complex, but two simplices in a simplicial cell complex may be glued
together along more than one simplex on their boundaries. In this
talk, I will discuss the characterization of face numbers of simplicial
cell decompositions of some manifolds.
