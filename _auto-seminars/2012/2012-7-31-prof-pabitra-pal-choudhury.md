title: "Birth of Integral Value Transformation (IVT) and some observations in Mathematics and in Genomics"
venue: "Department of Mathematics, Lecture Hall 1"

Firstly, regarding Carry Value Transformation (CVT) some
mathematical observations will be discussed. In using mathematical
tools in Genomics we adopted two-way path. One is model based,
another is issue based. Both these approaches will be discussed on
using Human Olfactory receptors.
