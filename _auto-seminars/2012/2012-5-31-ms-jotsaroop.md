The Grushin operator is defined as $G:=-\\triangle-|x|^2\\partial_t^2$
on R^{n+1}. We study the boundedness of the multipliers $m(G)$ of $G$ on
$L^p(R^{n+1})$. We prove the analogue of the Hormander-Mihlin theorem for
$m(G)$. We  also study the boundedness of the solution of the wave
equation corresponding to $G$ on $L^p(R^{n+1})$. The main tool in studying
the above is the operator-valued Fourier multiplier
theorem by Lutz Weis.
