We shall discuss a new result that relates grafting, which are
certain deformations of complex projective structures on a surface, to the
Teichmuller geodesic flow in the moduli space of Riemann surfaces. A
consequence is that for any fixed Fuchsian holonomy, such geometric
structures are dense in moduli space.
