In a foundational paper "Operators Possessing an Open Set of Eigenvalues"
written several decades ago, Cowen and Douglas showed that an operator T
on a Hilbert space H possessing an open set W (in complex plane) of
eigenvalues determines a holomorphic Hermitian vector bundle ET . One of
the basic theorems they prove states that the unitary equivalence class of
the operator T and the equivalence class of the holomorphic Hermitian
vector bundle ET are in one to one correspondence. This correspondence
appears somewhat mysterious until one detects the invariants for the
vector bundle ET in the operator T and vice-versa. Fortunately, this is
possible in some cases. Thus they point out that if the operator T
possesses the additional property that dimension of the eigenspace at each
point w in W is 1, then the map f on W, sending w to ker(T-w), admits a
non-zero holomorphic section, say S, and therefore defines a line bundle
LT on W.It is well known that the curvature KL of a line bundle LT is a
complete invariant for the line bundle LT . On the other hand, define
