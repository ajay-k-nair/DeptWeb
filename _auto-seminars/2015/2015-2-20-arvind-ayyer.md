title: "The dimer model and generalisations"
venue: "LH-I, Department of Mathematics, IISc."

In the first half of the talk, I will define the dimer model on
planar graphs and prove Kasteleyn's groundbreaking result
expressing the
partition function (i.e. the generating function) of the model as a
Pfaffian. I will then survey various results arising as a consequence,
culminating in the beautiful limit shape theorems of Kenyon, Okounkov and
coworkers.
