Let P be the equilibrium potential of a compact set K in R^n. An
electrostatic skeleton of K is a positive measure  such that the closed
support S of  has connected complement and empty interior, and the
Newtonian (or logarithmic, when n = 2) potential of  is equal to P
near infinity. We prove the existence and uniqueness of an electrostatic
skeleton for any simplex.
