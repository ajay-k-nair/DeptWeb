In this talk, I will give a proof of Alexandrovs theorem on the Gauss curvature prescription of Euclidean convex body. The proof is mainly based on mass transport. In particular, it doesnt rely on pdes method nor convex polyhedra theory. To proceed, I will discuss generalizations of well-known results for the quadratic cost to the case of a cost function which assumes infinite value.
