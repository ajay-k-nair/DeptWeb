Koszul duality theory is a homological method aiming at
constructing
an explicit quasi-free resolution for quadratic algebras. We introduce
the concepts of bar (and cobar) construction for a quadratic algebra
(and coalgebra) and provide a quasi-free resolution for quadratic
algebras, under certain assumptions.
