We study the local behavior of (extreme) quantiles of the sum of 
heavy-tailed random variables, to infer on risk concentration. Looking at the 
literature, asymptotic (for high threshold) results have been obtained when 
assuming (asymptotic) independence and second order regularly varying 
conditions on the variables. Other asymptotic results have been obtained in the 
dependent case when considering specific copula structures. Our contribution is 
to investigate on one hand, the non-asymptotic case (i.e. for any threshold), 
providing analytical results on the risk concentration for copula models that 
are used in practice, and comparing them with results obtained via Monte-Carlo 
method. On the other hand, when looking at extreme quantiles, we assume a 
multivariate second order regular variation condition on the vectors and 
provide asymptotic risk concentration results. We show that many models used in 
practice come under the purview of such an assumption and provide a few 
examples. Moreover this ties up related results available in the literature 
under a broad umbrella. This presentation is based on two joint works, one with 
M. Dacorogna and L. Elbahtouri (SCOR), the other with B. Das (SUTD).
