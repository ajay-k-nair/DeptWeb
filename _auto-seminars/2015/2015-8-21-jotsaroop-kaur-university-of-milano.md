- Define
$S_R^{\\alpha}f:=\\int_{\\R^d}(1-\\frac{|\\xi|^2}{R^2})_{+}^{\\alpha}\\hat{f}(\\xi)\\exp^{i2\\pi
x.\\xi}d\\xi,$ the Bochner Riesz means of order $\\alpha\\geq 0.$ Let $f\\in
L^2(\\R^d)$ and $f\\eq 0$ in an open, bounded set $B.$ Its known that
$S_R^{\\alpha}f goes to 0 a.e. in $B$ as $R\\rightarrow\\infty.$ We study the
pointwise convergence of Bochner Riesz means $S_{R}^{\\alpha}f, \\alpha>0$ as
$\\R$\\rightarrow \\infty$
on sets of positive Hausdorff measure in $\\R^d$ by making use of the decay
of the spherical means of Fourier Transform of fractal measures. We get an
improvement in the range of the Hausdorff dimension of the sets on which it
converges. When $0<\\alpha<\\frac{d-1}{4}$ we get the best possible result in
$\\R^2$ and in higher dimensions we improve the result by L.Colzani, G.
Gigante and A. Vargas. Steins interpolation theorem also gives us  the
corresponding
result for $f\\in L^p(\\R^d), 1<p<2.$
