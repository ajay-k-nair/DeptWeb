Unlike integer factorization, a reducible holomorphic eta quotient may not
factorize uniquely as a product of irreducible holomorphic eta quotients.
But whenever such an eta quotient is reducible, the occurrence of a
certain type of factor could be observed: We conjecture that if a
holomorphic eta
quotient f of level M is reducible, then f has a factor of level M.  In
particular, it implies that rescalings and Atkin-Lehner involutions of
irreducible holomorphic eta quotients are irreducible. We prove a number
of results towards this conjecture:  For example, we show that a reducible
holomorphic eta quotient of level M always factorizes nontrivially at some
level N which is a multiple of M such that rad(N) = rad(M) and moreover, N
is bounded from above by an explicit function of M. This implies a new and
much faster algorithm to check the irreducibility of holomorphic eta
quotients.  In particular,  we show that our conjecture holds if M is a
prime power. We also show that the level of any factor of a holomorphic
eta quotient f of level M and weight k is bounded w.r.t. M and k. Further,
we show that there are only finitely many irreducible holomorphic eta
quotients of a given level and provide a bound on the weights of such eta
quotients. Finally, we give an example of an infinite family of
irreducible holomorphic eta quotients of prime power levels.
