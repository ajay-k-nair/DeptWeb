Abstract : In this work, we study certain stability results for Ball Separationproperties in Banach Spaces leading to a discussion in the context of operator spaces. In this work, we study certain stability results for Small Combination of Slices Property (SCSP) leading to a discussion on SCSP in the context of operator spaces. SCSpoints were first introduced as a slice generalisation of the PC (i.e. point ofcontinuity points for which the identity mapping from weak topology to normtopology is continuous.) It is known that X is strongly regular respectively X*is w*-strongly regular) if and only if every non empty bounded convex set K in X ( respectively K in X*) is contained in the norm closure ( respectively w*- closure)of SCS(K)( respectively w*-SCS(K)) i.e. the SCS points ( w*- SCS points) of K. Later, it was proved that a Banach space has Radon- Nikodym Property (RNP) if and only if it is strongly regular and it has the Krein-Milamn Property(KMP). Subsequently, the concepts of SCS points was used to investigate the structure of non-dentable closed bounded convex sets in Banach spaces. The point version of the result was also shown to be true .
