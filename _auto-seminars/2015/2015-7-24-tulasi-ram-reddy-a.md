In the first part we study critical points of random
polynomials. We choose two deterministic sequences of complex numbers,
whose empirical measures converge to the same probability measure in
complex plane. We make a sequence of polynomials whose zeros are chosen
from either of sequences at random. We show that the limiting empirical
measure of zeros and critical points agree for these polynomials. As a
consequence we show that when we randomly perturb the zeros of a
deterministic sequence of polynomials, the limiting empirical measures of
zeros and critical points agree. This result can be interpreted as an
extension of earlier results where randomness is reduced. Pemantle and
Rivin initiated the study of critical points of random polynomials.
Kabluchko proved the result considering the zeros to be i.i.d. random
variables.
