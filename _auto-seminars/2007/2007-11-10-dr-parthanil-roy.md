We consider a point process sequence induced by a stationary 
symmetric -stable (0 < < 2) discrete parameter random eld. It is easy to 
prove, following the arguments in the one-dimensional case in Resnick and 
Samorodnitsky (2004), that if the random eld is generated by a dissipative 
group action then the point process sequence converges weakly to a cluster 
Poisson process. For the conservative case, no general result is known 
even in the one-dimensional case. We look at a specic class of stable 
random elds generated by conservative actions whose eective dimensions can 
be computed using the structure theorem of nitely generated abelian 
groups. The corresponding point processes sequence is not tight and hence 
needs to be properly normalized in order to ensure weak convergence. This 
weak limit is computed using extreme value theory and some counting 
techniques. (This talk is based on a joint work with Gennady 
Samorodnitsky)
