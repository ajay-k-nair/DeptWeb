Orbifolds are generally regarded as generalizations of manifolds. On the other hand, finite groups are also orbifolds. In this survey talk, I will focus on how orbifolds appear naturally in some important areas of Mathematics and Physics. I will also describe some features of the geometry of orbifolds.
