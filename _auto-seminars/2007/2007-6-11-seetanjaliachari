title: "Higher linking of Knots: Stallings theorem"
venue: "Lecture Hall - I, Dept. of Mathematics"

A central result used in studying higher linking of knots is a 
theorem of Stalling on lower central series. Stallings's proof was based 
on spectral sequences, but he indicated that the result can be proved 
directly using Hopf's description of homology of groups. In this talk 
Stallings theorem will be explained and a direct proof will be presented.
