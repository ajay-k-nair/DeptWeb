String theorists believe that elementary particles can be

   described by one dimensional string-like objects that propagate in

   certain geometries. An appropriate mathematical treatment combines the

   study of quantum field theory and geometry. Whether or not one

   believes in the physical (or even mathematical) reality of string

   theory as a whole, the idea to use one-dimensional "test particles" to

   investigate the properties of interesting geometries allows far

   reaching insights- both in quantum field theory and in geometry.
