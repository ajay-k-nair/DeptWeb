Hyperbolic balance laws with source terms allow non-unique entropy 
solutions.  By taking the source term as a variable and stating its time 
derivative to be zero, a balance law can be rewritten in a quasi-linear 
form. This then reveals the loss of strict hyperbolicity at critical 
states, the so called resonance phenomenon. Numerical schemes are 
sensitive to this phenomenon and it is uncertain, which entropy solution 
(if it is non-unique) will be created by an appropriate numerical scheme.
