Let $k$ be a field of characteristic not 2 and $G$ be an algebraic group defined over $k$. An element $t$ in $G(k)$ is called real if there exists $g\\\\in G(k)$ such that $gtg^{-1}=t^{-1}$. An element $t\\\\in G(k)$ is called strongly real if $t=\\\\tau_1\\\\tau_2$ where $\\\\tau_i\\\\in G(k)$ and $\\\\tau_i^2=1$. We discuss when a semisimple real element is strongly real in $G(k)$. We investigate this question for classical groups and the groups of type $G_2$ in detail.
