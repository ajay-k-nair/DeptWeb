More than 30 years after the Harvey-Wells paper on complex
approximation theory, we still do not know the answers to most of
the relevant approximation-theoretic questions on, say, a smooth,
compact 2-manifold (call it M) in C^2. Answering many of these
questions boils down to examining the local polynomial convexity of
M near those points where the (extrinsic) tangent space of M is a
complex subspace of the ambient C^2. We shall quickly survey what is
currently known, and then look at some recent progress based on
examining the Maslov index.
