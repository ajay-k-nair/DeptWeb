To an elliptic curve E, one can associate various twists
L(E,\\chi,s) of L-functions.  The values of these L-functions at integers
are expected to behave well under the action of a Galois group.  In this
talk, we will explain how a Galois group acts on some special L-values and
indicate some approaches in studying the behaviour under such actions.
