I will give a brief overview of Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last
Theorem, and explain the connection between modular forms and
elliptic curves via Galois representations e.g. the
Taniyama-Shimura conjecture. In the second half, I'll explain
some recent results on p-adic modular forms and deformations of
Galois representations. If time permits, I'll outline a future
project on ranks of elliptic curves.
