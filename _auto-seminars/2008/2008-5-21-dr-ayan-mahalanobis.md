The ElGamal cryptosystem is in the heart of public key 
cryptography. It is known that the MOR cryptosysetm generalizes it from 
the cyclic group to the automorphism group of a (non-abelian) group. I 
will start by describing the MOR cryptosystem and then we will use
the special linear group over a finite field as the platform group. It 
seems likely that this project is competitive with the elliptic curves 
over finite fields in terms of security. I'll explain why I think so. Then 
we can talk about challenges in implementation of this
cryptosystem.
