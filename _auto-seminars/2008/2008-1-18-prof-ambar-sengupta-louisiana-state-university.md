Yang-Mills gauge theory, classical as well as quantum, in two dimensions is both mathematically tractable and poses interesting questions. The quantum theory for the field has a mathematically precise formulation in terms of a Gaussian measure. Classical holonomies become group-valued random variables in this setting. This talk will present an overview of some mathematical problems, solutions, and ideas arising from two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory
