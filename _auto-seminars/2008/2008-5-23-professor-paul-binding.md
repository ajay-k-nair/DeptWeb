Many applied problems give rise to generalised eigenvalue problems of
the form Ay = s By, where A and B are operators of various possible
types, and s is an eigenparameter.  Two parameter embeddings  Ay = s
By - t Cy
generate useful methods of attack, and can be traced back about a century,
but new applications are still appearing. They provide ways to visualise
simply some quite complicated phenomena, and in this talk I will discuss
some older and newer ones that I have found interesting.
