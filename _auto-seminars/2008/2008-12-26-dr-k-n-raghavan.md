The talk will be a report on an ongoing research project (joint with Preena Samuel and K.V.Subrahmanyam). Representation theoretic consequences will be worked out of the combinatorial characterizations of left, right, and two-sided Kazhdan-Lusztig cells of the symmetric group. Applications to invariant theory and both ordinary and modular representation theory of the symmetric group will be given.
