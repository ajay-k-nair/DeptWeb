In the standard stochastic geometric setting, wireless networks can be 
modeled as point processes and their performances as certain mean functionals 
of the point process. Obtaining closed form expressions of such functionals is 
not easy for a general class of point processes. This motivates a comparative 
study. We study comparison of one such class of mean functionals - the additive 
and extremal shot-noise fields - which arise naturally in modeling of wireless 
networks, as ingredients of the so called Signal-to-Interference-Noise-Ratio.
