We consider a system coupling the Stokes system with an elastic
structure modelled by a finite dimensional system. We prove that this 
system can be driven to zero by a control action only in the
fluid equation. The proof is based on a global Carleman inequality. 
Because of the coupling between the fluid equation and the
structure new boundary terms appear in the Carleman inequality, and 
estimating these terms requires new techniques.
