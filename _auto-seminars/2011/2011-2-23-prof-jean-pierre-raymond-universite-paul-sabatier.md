In finite-dimensional control theory, feedback control using
controllability Gramian goes back to results by Kleinman and Lukes in
1968 and 1970. Some years before, R. Bass characterized controls of
minimal norms also using controllability Gramians. The extension of
these results to infinite-dimensional systems has a long history.
Surprisingly, only reversible infinite-dimensional systems have been
considered in those results. We shall present existing results in the
literature and we shall characterize stabilizing controls of minimal
norms for parabolic systems. This is a joint work with S. Kesavan.
Application to the stabilization of the Navier-Stokes equations will
be given.
