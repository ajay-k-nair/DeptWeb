The Goldman bracket associates a Lie Algebra to closed curves
on a surface. I shall describe the bracket and its basic properties. I
shall also sketch some joint work with Moira Chas, where we show that
the Goldman bracket together with the operation of taking powers
determines geometric intersection and self-intersection numbers.
