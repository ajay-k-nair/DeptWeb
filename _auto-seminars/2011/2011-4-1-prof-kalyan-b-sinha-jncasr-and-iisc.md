Beginning with the attempts of Heisenberg and Pauli in the 1920's,
the subject grewat an astonishing speed, culminating in the
remarkable predictive successof Quantum Electrodynamics.Different
attemptsto bring the subjectto a sound mathematical footing
(comparable to that of Quantum Mechanics)-- whetheranalytic,
operator-algebraic or geometric -- have tastedonly partial success.
These talks will try to give a bird's-eye view of the mathematical
areas (ideas)spawned by these attempts, keeping in view the recent
book of Folland on this subject.
