The empirical spectral distribution (ESD) of the sample variance
covariance matrix of i.i.d. observations under suitable moment
conditions converges almost surely as the dimension tends to
infinity. The limiting spectral distribution (LSD) is universal and
is known in closed form with support [0,4].
