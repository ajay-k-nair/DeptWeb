I will explain how the purely combinatorial Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence can be used to give a simple proof of the classification of irreducible representations of symmetric groups in the semisimple case. It turns out that all the standard results in the representation theory of symmetric groups can be recovered using this approach.
