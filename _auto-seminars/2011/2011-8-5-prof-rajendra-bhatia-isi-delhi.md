Let f be a smooth function on the real line. The divided difference
matrices of order n, whose, (i,j)-th entries are the divided differences
of f at (\\lambda_i,\\lambda_j) -- where \\lambda_1,...,\\lambda_n are
prescribed real numbers -- are called Loewner matrices. In a seminal
paper published in 1934 Loewner used properties of these matrices to
characterise operator monotone functions. In the same paper he established
connections between this matrix problem, complex analytic functions, and
harmonic analysis. These elegant connections sent Loewner matrices into
the background. Some recent work has brought them back into focus. In
particular, characterisation of operator convex functions in terms of
Loewner matrices has been obtained. In this talk we describe some of
this work.
