In this talk, we shall study about the leaking rate of the
Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen (SRB) measure through holes of positive measure
constructed in the Julia set of hyperbolic rational maps (open dynamics).
The dependence of this rate on the size and position of the hole shall be
explained. For an easier and better understanding, the simple quadratic
map restricted on the unit circle will be analysed thoroughly. Time
permitting, we will also compute the Hausdorff dimension of the survivor
set.
