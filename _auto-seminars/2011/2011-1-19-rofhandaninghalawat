title: "Serre's mass formula in prime degree"
venue: "Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics"

Serre's mass formula counts the number of totally ramified degree-$n$
extensions $E$ of a local field $F$, each extension being assigned
some weight depending upon how ramified it is. We will present an
elementary proof of this formula when the degree $n$ is prime.The
background material will be covered, so that the talk should be
accessible to a broad mathematical audience.
