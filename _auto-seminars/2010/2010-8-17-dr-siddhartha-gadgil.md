The space of all complex structures on a surface, and the
Deligne-Mumford compactification of this space, play an important
role in many areas of mathematics. We give a combinatorial
description of a space that is homotopy equivalent to the
Deligne-Mumford compactification, in the case of surfaces with at
least one puncture.
