Let D be a smoothly bounded pseudoconvex domain in C^n, n > 1. Using
G(z, p), the Green function for D with pole at p in D, associated
with
the standard sum-of-squares Laplacian, N. Levenberg and H. Yamaguchi had
constructed a Kahler metric (the so-called Lambda--metric) using the Robin
function arising from G(z, p). The purpose of this thesis is to study this
metric by deriving its boundary asymptotics and using them to calculate
the holomorphic sectional curvature along normal directions. It is also
shown that the Lambda--metric is comparable to the Kobayashi (and hence to
the Bergman and Caratheodory metrics) when D is strongly pseudoconvex. The
unit ball in C^n is also characterized among all smoothly bounded strongly
convex domains on which the Lambda--metric has constant negative
holomorphic sectional curvature. This may be regarded as a version of
Lu-Qi Keng's theorem for the Bergman metric.
