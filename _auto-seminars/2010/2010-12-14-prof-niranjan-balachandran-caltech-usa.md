One of the fundamental problems in Extremal Combinatorics concerns
maximal set systems with forbidden subconfigurations. One such open
problem concerns the conjecture due to Anstee and Sali on the order
of maximal configurations with certain forbidden subconfigurations.
I shall talk about some well known results, talk about the Anstee-Sali
conjecture, and finally talk about some of my recent work concerning
Steiner designs occuring as maximal forbidden configurations for
certain natural choices of subconfigrations. This generalizes a
result of Anstee and Barekat.
