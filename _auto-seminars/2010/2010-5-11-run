We derive the conservation form of equations of evolution of a
front propagating in three dimensions. We obtain a system of six
conservation laws, known as 3-D kinematical conservation laws (KCL) in a
ray coordinate system. The conservative variables of 3-D KCL are also
constrained by a stationary vector constraint, known as geometric
solenoidal constraint, which consists of three divergence-free type
conditions. The 3-D KCL is an under-determined system, and therefore,
additional closure relations are required to get a complete set of
equations. We consider two closure relations for 3-D KCL:
(1) energy transport equation of a weakly nonlinear ray theory (WNLRT) to
study the propagation of a nonlinear wavefront,
(2) transport equations of a shock ray theory (SRT) to study the
propagation of a curved weak shock front.
In both the cases we obtain a weakly hyperbolic system of balance laws.
For the numerical simulation we use a high-resolution semi-discrete
central scheme. The second order accuracy of the scheme is based on MUSCL
type   reconstructions and TVD Runge-Kutta time stepping procedures. A
constrained transport technique is used to enforce the geometric
solenoidal constraint and in all the test problems considered, the
constraint is satisfied up to very high accuracy. We present the results
of extensive numerical experiments, which confirm the efficiency and
robustness of the method and also its ability to capture many physically
realistic features of the fronts.
