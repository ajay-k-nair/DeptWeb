Free  groups and the group of their outer
automorphisms have been extensively studied in analogy with
(fundamental groups of) surfaces and the mapping class groups of
surfaces.

    We study the analogue of intersection numbers of simple curves,
namely the Scott-Swarup algebraic intersection number  of splittings
of a free group and we also study embedded spheres in $3$- manifold
of the form $ M =\sharp_n S^2 \times S^1 $. The fundamental group of
$M$ is a free group of
rank $n$. This $3$-manifold will be our model for free groups. We
construct geosphere laminations in free group which are analogues of
geodesic laminations on a surface.
