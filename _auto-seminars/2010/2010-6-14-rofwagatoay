Kunze Stein inequality can be thought of as a semisimple 
version of Young's inequality. A remarkable observation of M.G.Cowling and 
S.Meda shows that these inequalities can be naturally extended to Lorentz 
spaces. The final result in this direction was proved by A. Ionescu. In this 
talk we will try to explain the central ideas behind Kunze Stein type
convolution inequalities for Lorentz spaces.
