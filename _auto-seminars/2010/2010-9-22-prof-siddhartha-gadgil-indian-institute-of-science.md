A geometry is a collection of lines and points satisfying the usual incidence axioms. By a theorem of Gromov, given an almost complex structure (which is `tame') on the complex projective plane CP^2, we obtain a geometry by declaring appropriate holomorphic curves to be the lines. Ghys asked whether Desargues's theorem (a Euclidean geometry result related to symmetry) characterises the standard complex structure. We show that this is indeed the case.
