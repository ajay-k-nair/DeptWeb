One of the most important subclasses of the class of normalized
analytic univalent functions on the open unit disc D is the class of
convex functions. In this talk we will focus on meromorphic analogues of
the results known for this class. I.e. we consider functions that map D
conformally onto a set whose complement is a bounded convex set. We shall
begin with a brief history of Livingston's conjecture which concerns the
exact set of variability of the Taylor coefficients for concave functions.
Thereafter, we shall discuss some new results concerning the closed convex
hull of concave functions and extreme points of it.
