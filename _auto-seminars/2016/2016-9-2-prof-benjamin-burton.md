Multiobjective optimisation involves optimising several quantities, such
as time and money,
simultaneously.  The result is a polyhedral frontier of "best possible"
solutions, which cannot
improve one quantity without a trade-off against another.  For linear
programming, this
frontier can be generated using Benson's outer approximation algorithm,
which uses a
sequence of scalarisations (single-objective optimisations), combined with
classical
algorithms from polytope theory.
