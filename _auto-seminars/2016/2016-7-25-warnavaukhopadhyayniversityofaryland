Classical invariants for representations of one Lie group can often be
related to invariants of some other Lie group. Physics suggests that the
right objects to consider for these questions are certain refinements of
classical invariants known as conformal blocks. Conformal blocks appear in
algebraic geometry as spaces of global sections of line bundles on the
moduli stack of parabolic bundles on a smooth curve. Rank-level duality
connects a conformal block associated to one Lie algebra to a conformal
block for a different Lie algebra.
