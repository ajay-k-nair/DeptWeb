We shall introduce the definition of a k-mode Gaussian state
and a chain of such states which determine a C* probability space. We
present examples of such states exhibiting properties like
exchangeability and stationarity. Stationary chains are determined by
block Toeplitz matrices. Using the Kac-Murdoch-Szego theorems on
asymptotic spectral distributions of Toeplitz matrices we compute the
entropy rates of some of these chains. This leaves many natural problems
open.
