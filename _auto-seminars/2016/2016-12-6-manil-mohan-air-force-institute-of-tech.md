title: "Some Recent Progress in Quasilinear Hyperbolic Systems: New Local Solvability Methods and Stochastic Analysis."
venue: ""
---
Quasilinear symmetric and symmetrizable hyperbolic system has a
wide range
of
applications in engineering and physics including unsteady Euler and
potential
equations of
gas dynamics, inviscid magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, shallow water
equations,
non-Newtonian fluid dynamics, and Einstein  field equations of general
relativity.
In the past,
the Cauchy problem of smooth solutions for these systems has been studied
by several
mathematicians using semigroup approach and fixed point arguments. In a
recent work
of M.
T. Mohan and S. S. Sritharan, the local solvability of symmetric
hyperbolic system is
established using two different methods, viz. local monotonicity method and a
frequency
truncation method. The local existence and uniqueness of solutions of
symmetrizable
hyperbolic system is also proved by them using a frequency truncation
method. Later
they
established the local solvability of the stochastic quasilinear symmetric
hyperbolic
system
perturbed by Levy noise using a stochastic generalization of the localized
Minty-Browder
technique. Under a smallness assumption on the initial data, a global
solvability
for the
multiplicative noise case is also proved. The essence of this talk is to
give an
overview of
these new local solvability methods and their applications.
