We give a relatively simple proof of the famous theorem of
Narasimhan and Seshadri on vector bundles on a compact Riemann surface.
The theorem relates the algebraic geometric notion of stability of vector
bundles on a compact Riemann surface with a transcendental construct -
unitary representations of a suitable Fuchsian group associated to the
Riemann surface.
