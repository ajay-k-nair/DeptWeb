Abstract:
Given a proper coarse structure on a locally compact Hausdorff space $X$,
one can construct the Higson compactification for the coarse structure. In
the opposite direction given a compactification of $X$, one can construct
a coarse structure. We use unitizations of a non-unital C$^*$\nobreakdash-
algebra $A$ to define a noncommutative coarse structure on $A$. We also
set up a framework to abstract coarse maps to this noncommutative setting.
The original motivation for this work comes from Physics where quantum
phenomenon when probed at large scales give classical results. We show
equivalence of the canonical coarse structure on the classical plane
$\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ with a certain noncommutative coarse structure on the
Moyal plane which models the hypothetical phase space of Quantum physics.
If time permits we shall also discuss other examples of noncommutative
coarse equivalences. This is a joint work with Prof. Ralf Meyer.
