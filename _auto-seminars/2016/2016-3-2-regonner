One of the most useful analogies in mathematics is the

fundamental group functor (also known as the Galois Correspondence) which

sends a topological space to its fundamental group while at the same time

sending continuous maps between spaces to corresponding homomorphisms of

groups in such a way that compositions of maps are preserved.
