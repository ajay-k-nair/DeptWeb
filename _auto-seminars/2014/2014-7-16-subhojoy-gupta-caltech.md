Complex projective structures on a surface S arise in the
"complex-analytic" description of Teichmller space. The operation of
grafting parametrizes the space P(S) of such structures, and yields paths
in Teichmller space called "grafting rays". I shall introduce these, and
describe a result concerning their asymptotic behavior. This talk shall be
mostly expository.
