The non-backtracking matrix of a graph is a non-symmetric matrix
on the oriented edge of a graph which has interesting algebraic
properties and appears notably in connection with the Ihara zeta
function and in some generalizations of Ramanujan graphs. It has
also be proposed recently in the context of community detection. In
this talk, we will study the largest eigenvalues of this matrix for
the Erdos-Renyi graph G(n,c/n) and other simple inhomogeneous random
graphs. This is a joint work with Marc Lelarge and Laurent Maussouli.
