I will talk about techniques to approximate real functions such as $x^s,$
$x^{-1}$ and $e^{-x}$ by "simpler" functions and how these
results can be used in the design of fast algorithms. The key lies in the
fact that such approximations imply faster ways to
approximate primitives such as $A^sv,$ $A^{-1}v$ and $\exp({-A})v$, and in
the computation of matrix eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
Indeed, many fast algorithms reduce to the computation of such
primitives, which have proved useful for speeding up several
fundamental computations, such as random walk simulation, graph
partitioning, solving linear systems of equations, and combinatorial
approaches for solving semi-definite programs.
