In this expository talk, I will focus on  CMC surfaces which
are not minimal surfaces. I will talk about the link between CMC
surfaces and integrable systems. I will then talk about how CMC
surfaces fall out of a constrained optimization problem. I will give
examples of rotational and helicoidal CMC surfaces and the isometry
between them. If time permits I will talk about  the classification
of CMC surfaces, namely its Weirstrass representation.
