In noncommutative geometry (NCG) one typically treats unital C*-algebras
as noncommutative compact spaces via Gelfand-Naimark duality. In various
applications of NCG to problems in geometry or topology it is customary to
first reformulate these problems in terms of certain (co)homology
theories for noncommutative spaces. The celebrated Baum-Connes conjecture,
that reduces the Novikov conjecture to an assertion in bivariant K-theory,
is a prime example of this principle. However, the category of
C*-algebras is well-known to be deficient from the viewpoint of homotopy
theory or index theory. In this talk I am going to first survey certain
(co)homology theories for noncommutative spaces, then present my proposed
solution to the aforementioned problem, and finally (time permitting)
discuss some applications. I will try to keep it non-technical and
accessible to a wide range of audience.
