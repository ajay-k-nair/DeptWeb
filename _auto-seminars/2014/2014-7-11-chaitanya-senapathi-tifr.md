1961 Frankel in a novel approach used the curvature of Complex Projective
space to show complex submanifolds of complimentary dimension intersect.
Based on this approach Scheon and Wolfson reproved the Barth-Lefshetz type
theorems using the Morse Theory on the space of paths, in the case the
ambient space is a Hermitian Symmetric Space. In this talk we describe how
to extend their work to a much larger class of Homogenous spaces.
