Given n non-zero real numbers v_1,...,v_n, what is the maximum
possible number of subsets {i_1,...,i_k} that can have the same
subset sum v_{i_1}+...+v_{i_n}? Littlewood and Offord raised the
question, showed that the answer is at most 2^nlog(n)/\sqrt{n} and
conjectured that the log(n) can be removed. Erdos proved the
conjecture and raised more questions that have continued to attract
attention, primarily relating the arithmetic structure of
v_1,...,v_n and the maximum number of subsets with a given
subset-sum.
