In this expository talk, I will first review prequantization
of symplectic manifolds. I will then talk of polarizations and
geometric quantization. I will then focus on geometric quantization of
Kahler manifolds and the Rawnsley coherent states. If time permits I
will talk of coadjoint orbits and coherent states.
