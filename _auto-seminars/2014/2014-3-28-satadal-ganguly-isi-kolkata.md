A great progress on the twin prime problem was made last year by Yitang Zhang and it made him famous in Mathematical circles almost overnight. He proved the existence of a positive real number M such that there are infinitely many pairs of primes that differ by at most M. The twin prime conjecture predicts that M can be taken to be two. I shall give an overview of the works leading up to Zhang's spectacular achievement.
