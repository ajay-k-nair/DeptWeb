title: "A dynamic model of capital inflow and financial crisis in a two country and multi-country framework over infinite time horizon"
venue: "LH-I, department of mathematics"

We construct a model of capital inflow in a two and multi-country 
framework. A capital-scarce country, typically a developing country with a high 
return on capital borrows from a capital-rich country, typically a developed 
country to finance domestic investment. In the process both the countries gain, 
raising the world welfare. We formulate the problem in terms of utility 
maximization with respect to both develop and developing countries' perspective 
over infinite time horizon and numerically solve for optimal interest rate, 
borrowing/lending amount, exchange rate using dynamic programming principle.
