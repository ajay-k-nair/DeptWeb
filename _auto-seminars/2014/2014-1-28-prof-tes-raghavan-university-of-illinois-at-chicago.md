If the data defining a problem and at least one solution to the
problem lie in the same Archimedean ordered  field induced by the  data, 
we say that the problem has order field property.
When this property holds one may hope to do  only finitely many
arithmetic operations on the data to arrive at one such a solution.  For
example if we start with rational data, the value and a pair of optimal
strategies for the players in a zero sum two person game have rational
entries.  This was first noticed by Herman Weyl , and it was a precursor
to solving them via  the simplex method. For bimatrix games while  Nash
exhibited an equilibrium in mixed strategies, it was Vorobev  and Kuhn who
checked that  the order field property holds for bimatrix games. Later
Lemke and Howson gave the so called linear complementarity  algorithm to
locate an  equilibrium pair in the same data field. For three  person
games,  Nash with Shapley constructed simple counter examples for lack of
order field property.  In general  stochastic games fail to have order
field property.
