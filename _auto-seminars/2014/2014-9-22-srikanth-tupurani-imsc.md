I will prove the following interesting result about finite dimensional
complex semi-simple algebra. Let A be a finite-dimensional complex
semi-simple algebra without an M_{2}(C) summand and let S be an
involutive unital C-algebra anti-automorphism of A. Then there exists an
element a in A such that a and S(a) generate A as an algebra. In the proof
I will use some basic results in linear algebra
