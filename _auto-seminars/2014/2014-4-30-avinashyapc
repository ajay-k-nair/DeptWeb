The dynamics of excursions of Brownian motion into a set with
more than one boundary point , which no longer have the structure
of a Poisson process, requires an extension of Ito's excursion
theory , due to B.Maisonneuve. In this talk we provide a `bare hands'
calculation of the relevant objects - local time, excursion measure -
in the simple case of Brownian excursions
into an interval (a,b), without using the Maisonneuve theory.
We apply these computations to calculate
the asymptotic distribution of excursions into an interval, straddling
a fixed time t, as t  goes to infinity.
