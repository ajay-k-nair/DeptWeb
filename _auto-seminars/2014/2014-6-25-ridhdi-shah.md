title: "Dynamics of Distal Group Actions"
time: "3-4 pm"

An automorphism T of a locally compact group is said to be
distal if the closure of the T-orbit of any nontrivial element stays away
from the identity. We discuss some properties of distal actions on groups.
We will also relate distal groups with behaviour of powers of
probability measures on it.
