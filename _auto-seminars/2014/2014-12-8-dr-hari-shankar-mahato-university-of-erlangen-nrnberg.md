A porous medium (concrete, soil, rocks, water reservoir, e.g.) is a
multiscale medium where the heterogeneities present in the medium are
characterized by the micro scale and the global behaviors of the medium
are observed by the macro scale. The upscaling from the micro scale to the
macro scale can be done via averaging methods.
