title: "Homogenization of quasilinear parabolic problems by the method of Rothe and two scale convergence"
venue: "Lecture Hall V, Department of Mathematics"
---
In this talk we consider a linear parabolic problem with time dependent
coefficients oscillating rapidly in the space variable. The existence and
uniqueness results are proved by using Rothe&#146;'s method combined with
the technique of two-scale convergence. Moreover, we derive a concrete
homogenization algorithm for giving a unique and computable approximation
of the solution.
