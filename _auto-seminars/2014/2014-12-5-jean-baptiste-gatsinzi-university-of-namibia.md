We  recall some facts about Rational Homotopy Theory, from both Sullivan
and Quillen points of view. We show how to find a Sullivan model of a
homogeneous space  G/H . Let  M  be a closed oriented smooth manifold of
dimension  d  and  LM= map(S^1, M)  denote the space of free loops on  M .
Using intersection products, Chass and Sullivan defined a product on
\\mathbb{H}_*(LM)=H_{*+d} (LM)   that turns to be a graded commutative
algebra and defined a bracket on  \\mathbb{H}_*(LM)   making of it a
Gerstenhaber algebra. From the work of Jones, Cohen, F\\'elix, Thomas and
others there is an isomorphism of Gerstenhaber algebras between the
Hochschild cohomology   HH^*(C^*(M), C^*(M))  and  \\mathbb{H}_*(LM) .
Using a Sullivan model    (\\land V, d)  of  M , we show that that the
Gerstenhaber bracket  can be computed  in terms of derivations on   (\\land
V, d) .  Precisely, we show that   HH^*(\\land V, \\land V)   is isomorphic
to   H_*(\\land(V)\\otimes  \\land Z , D) , where  Z  is the dual of  V .  We
will illustrate with computations for homogeneous spaces.
