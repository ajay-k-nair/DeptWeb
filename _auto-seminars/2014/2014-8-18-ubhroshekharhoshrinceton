This talk will concern asymptotic estimates at infinity for
positive harmonic functions in a large class of non-smooth unbounded
domains. These are domains whose sections, after rescaling, resemble a
Lipschitz cylinder or a Lipschitz cone, e.g., various paraboloids and
horns. We will also mention a few related results in probability, e.g
harmonic measure (distribution of exit position of Brownian motion)
estimates.
