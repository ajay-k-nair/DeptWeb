We will use transcendental shift-like automorphisms of C^k ,k>2
to construct two examples of non-degenerate entire mappings with
prescribed ranges. The first example generalizes a result of Dixon-Esterle
in C^2, i.e., we construct an entire mapping of C^k, k>2 whose range
avoids a given polydisc but contains the complement of a slightly larger
concentric polydisc. The second example shows the existence of a
Fatou-Bieberbach domain in C^k, k>2 that is constrained to lie in a
prescribed region. This is motivated by similar results of Buzzard and
Rosay-Rudin.
