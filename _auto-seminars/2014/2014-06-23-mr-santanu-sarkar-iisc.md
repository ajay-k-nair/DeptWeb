This thesis investigates two different types of problems in multi variable operator theory. The first one deals with the defect sequence for contractive tuples and maximal contractive tuples. The second one deals with the wandering subspaces of the Bergman space and the Dirichilet space over polydisc. These are described in (I) and (II) below.
