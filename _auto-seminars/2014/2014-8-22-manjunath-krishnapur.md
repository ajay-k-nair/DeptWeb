Given n non-zero real numbers v_1,...,v_n, what is the maximum possible number of subsets {i_1,...,i_k} that can have the same subset sum v_{i_1}+...+v_{i_n}? Littlewood and Offord raised the question, showed that the answer is at most 2^nlog(n)/\\\\sqrt{n} and conjectured that the log(n) can be removed. Erdos proved the conjecture and raised more questions that have continued to attract attention, primarily relating the arithmetic structure of v_1,...,v_n and the maximum number of subsets with a given subset-sum.
