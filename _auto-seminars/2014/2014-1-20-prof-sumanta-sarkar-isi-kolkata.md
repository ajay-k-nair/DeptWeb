A Boolean function is a mapping from the set of all binary
n-tuples to the set {0, 1}. Boolean functions are important building
blocks in designing secure cryptosystems known as stream ciphers. Boolean
functions also form an important class of linear codes, known as the
Reed-Muller codes. Over the last few decades, a lot of research has been
done on Boolean function for its applications in cryptography and coding
theory.
