Given a hyperbolic surface, the set of all closed geodesics whose
length is minimal form a graph on the surface, in fact a so called fat
graph, which we call the systolic graph. The central question that we study
in this thesis is: which fat graphs are systolic graphs for some surface -
we call such graphs admissible. This is motivated in part by the observation
that we can naturally decompose the moduli space of hyperbolic surfaces
based on the associated systolic graphs.

        A systolic graph has a metric on it, so that all cycles on the
graph that correspond to geodesics are of the same length and all other
cycles have length greater than these. This can be formulated as a simple
condition in terms of equations and inequations for sums of lengths of
edges. We call this combinatorial admissibility.

        Our first main result is that admissibility is equivalent to
combinatorial admissibility. This is proved using properties of negative
curvature, specifically that polygonal curves with long enough sides, in
terms of a lower bound on the angles, are close to geodesics.

       Using the above result, it is easy to see that a subgraph of an
admissible graph is admissible. Hence it suffices to characterize minimal
non-admissible fat graphs. Another major result of this thesis is that there
are infinitely many minimal non-admissible fat graphs (in contrast, for
instance, to the classical result that there are only two minimal non-planar
graphs).
