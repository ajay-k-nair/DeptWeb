The mammalian heart must function as an efficient pump while simultaneously

      conducting electrical signals to drive the contraction process. In the

      ventricles,

      electrical activation begins at the insertion points of the Purkinje

      network in the

      sub-endocardium. Classically this contraction signal has been modeled as a

      reaction-diffusion equation with a spatially varying diffusion tensor. How

      does the

      diffusion component of this signal propagate from the endocardium in a

      healthy heart

      wall without creating potentially deadly arrhythmias? Using the duality

      between

      diffusion and Brownian motion together and a cardiac manifold described by a

      generalized helicoid, we show that this helicoidal arrangement of myocytes

      minimizes

      the directional biases that could lead to aberrant propagation. Thus we

      take a step

      towards closing the gap between mechanical and electrical requirements: the

      heartâ€™s pumping architecture appears to also be an ideal conductive medium.
