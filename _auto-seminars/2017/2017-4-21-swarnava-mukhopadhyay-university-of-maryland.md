title: "Conformal blocks, strange duality and the moduli space of curves."
time: "10 am (via skype)"

Conformal blocks are refined invariants of tensor product of

representations of a Lie algebra that give a special class of vector

bundles on the moduli space of curves. In this talk, I will introduce

conformal blocks and explore connections to questions in algebraic

geometry

and representation theory. I will also focus on some ``strange" dualities

in representation theory and how they give equalities of divisor classes

on

the moduli space of curves.
