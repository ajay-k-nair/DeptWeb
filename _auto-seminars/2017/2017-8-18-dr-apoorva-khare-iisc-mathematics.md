I will give a gentle historical (and ongoing) account of matrix positivity
and of operations that preserve it. This is a classical question studied
for much of the past century, including by Schur, Polya-Szego, Schoenberg,
Kahane, Loewner, and Rudin. It continues to be pursued actively, for both
theoretical reasons as well as applications to high-dimensional covariance
estimation. I will end with some recent joint work with Terence Tao
(UCLA).
