title: "Approximate controllability of an impulsive sub-diffusion equation."
venue: ""
---
In this talk, I shall consider an abstract Cauchy problem for a class of
impulsive
sub-diffusion equation.
Existence and regularity of solution of the problem shall be established
via eigenfunction expansion.
Further, I shall establish the approximate controllability of the problem by
applying unique continuation property via internal control acts on a
sub-domain.
