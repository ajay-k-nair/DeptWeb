Visual proofs of identities were common at the Greek time, such as the 
Pythagoras theorem. In the same spirit, with the renaissance of combinatorics, 
visual proofs of much deeper identities become possible. Some identities can be 
interpreted at the combinatorial level, and the identity is a consequence of 
the construction a weight preserving bijection between the objects interpreting 
both sides of the identity.
