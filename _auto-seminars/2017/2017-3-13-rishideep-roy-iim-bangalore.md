Extreme values and entropic repulsion for two-dimensional discrete 
Gaussian free fields are of significant interest and have been a subject of 
many recent works. Our work is on a general class of Gaussian fields with 
logarithmic correlations, of which the discrete Gaussian free field in 2 
dimension is a particular example. We will first conclude tightness for this 
field from the correlation structure. It also involves defining a general class 
of models with some assumptions on the covariance structure at microscopic and 
macroscopic levels which are good enough to ensure convergence of distribution 
of the maximum, after appropriate centering.
