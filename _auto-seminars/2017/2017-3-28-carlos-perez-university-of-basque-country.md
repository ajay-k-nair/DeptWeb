Commutators of singular integral operators with BMO functions were introduced in the seventies by Coifman-Rochberg and Weiss. These operators are very interesting for many reasons, one of them being the fact that they are more singular than Calder &#769;on-Zygmundm operators. In this lecture we plan to give several reasons showing the bad behavior of these operators.
