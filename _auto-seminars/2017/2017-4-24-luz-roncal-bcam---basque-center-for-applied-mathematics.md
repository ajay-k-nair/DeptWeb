The study of weighted inequalities in Classical Harmonic
Analysis started in 70's, when B. Muckenhoupt characterised in 1972 the
weights $w$ for which the Hardy--Littlewood maximal function is bounded in
$L^p(w)$. At that time the question about how the operator depended on the
constant associated with $w$, which we denote by $[w]_{A_p}$, was not
considered (i.e., \\textit{quantitative estimates}) were not investigated.
