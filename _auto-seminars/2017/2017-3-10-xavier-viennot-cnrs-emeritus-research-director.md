The PASEP (partially asymmetric exclusion model) is a model of particles hopping on a one-dimensional strip of N sites with open boundaries. It has been intensively studied by physicists and appears as a toy model in the physics of dynamical systems. The distribution of stationary probabilities has been computed using the so-called matrix ansatz (Derrida, Evans, Hakim, Pasquier). The solution involves a certain quadratic algebra and a representation of this algebra with infinite tridiagonal matrices related to the Askey-Wilson polynomials. These polynomials are a famous family of orthogonal polynomials which sit at the top of the hierarchy of classical orthogonal polynomials.
