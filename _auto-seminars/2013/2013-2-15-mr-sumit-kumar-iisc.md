Let H be a separable Hilbert space over the complex field. The
class $$ {{\\bold{S}}} := \\lbrace N|_{M} : N \\mbox{ is normal on H and M is
an invariant subspace for $N$} \\rbrace$$ of operators was introduced by
Halmos and consists of subnormal operators. Each subnormal operator
possesses a unique minimal normal extension $\\hat{N}$  as shown by Halmos.
Halmos proved that $\\sigma(\\hat{N}) \\subseteq \\sigma( {S})$ and then Bram
proved that $\\sigma({S})$ is obtained by filling certain number of holes
in the spectrum $\\sigma(\\hat{N})$ of the minimal normal extension
$\\hat{N}$ of a subnormal operator S.
