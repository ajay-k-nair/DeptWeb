The mean curvature flow is a process under which a submanifold is deformed in its mean curvature vector's direction. This process received more attention since it is an efficient way to construct submanifold which minimizes the volume : it is the negative gradient flow of volume functional. In this firs talk. I will discuss about basic tools in the study of mean curvature and describe some examples .
