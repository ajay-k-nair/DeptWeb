In this talk, we shall discuss the complex of HNN - extensions associated to the free group F_n of finite rank n. We shall sketch a proof the following result The group of simplicial automorphisms of this complex is isomorphic to the group Out(F_n) of outer automorphisms of the free group F_n of rank n.
