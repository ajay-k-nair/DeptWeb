We consider non-local currents in the context of quantized affine algebras. In two special cases, these currents can be identified with configurations in the six-vertex and Izergin--Korepin nineteen-vertex models. Mapping these to their corresponding Temperley--Lieb loop models, we directly identify non-local currents with discretely holomorphic loop observables. In particular, we show that the bulk discrete holomorphicity relation and its recently derived boundary analogue are equivalent to conservation laws for non-local currents. Joint with Y. Ikhlef, R. Weston and M. Wheeler.
