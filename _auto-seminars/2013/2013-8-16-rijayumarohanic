In this lecture we will study the well posedness problem for the nonlinear
Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the magnetic Laplacian on $\R^{2n}$,
corresponding to constant magnetic field, namely the twisted Laplacian on
$\C^n$.
We establish the well posednes in certain first order Sobolev spaces
associated
to the twisted Laplacian, and also in $L^2(\C^n)$.
