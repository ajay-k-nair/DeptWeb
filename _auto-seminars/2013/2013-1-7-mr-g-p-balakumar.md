This talk will be on two themes that illustrate the rigidity and regularity of holomorphic mappings. The first part will deal with results concerning the smoothness of continuous CR (Cauchy -- Riemann) mappings; in particular, that of Lipschitz continuous CR mappings from h-extendible/semi-regular hypersurfaces into certain Levi co-rank one hypersurfaces, in C^n. The second part will deal with the classification of Kobayashi hyperbolic, finite type rigid polynomial domains with abelian automorphism group in C^3.
