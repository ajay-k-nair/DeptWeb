title: "Beurling-Lax-Halmos Theorem and Operator Theory"
venue: "Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics"

This talk will be an elementary introduction to (Hilbert) module
approach to operator theory. We explore the relationship of the
classical von Neumann-Wold decomposition theorem and the
Beurling-Lax-Halmos theorem for isometries. We will also discuss
a unified approach to the invariant subspace problem for bounded
linear operators on Hilbert spaces. The talk will be accessible to
a general audience including graduate students.
