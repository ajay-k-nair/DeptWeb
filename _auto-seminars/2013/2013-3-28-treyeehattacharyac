We discuss two topics in this talk. First we study compact
Ricci-flat 4- manifolds without boundary and obtain pointwise restrictions
on curvature (not involving global quantities such as volume and diameter)
which force the metric to be flat. We obtain the same conclusion for
compact Ricci-flat Khler surfaces with similar but weaker restrictions on
holomorphic sectional curvature. Next we study the reaction ODE associated
to the evolution of the Riemann curvature operator along the Ricci flow.
We analyze the behavior of this ODE near algebraic curvature operators of
certain special type that includes the Riemann curvature operators of
various symmetric spaces. We explicitly show the existence of some
solution curves to the ODE connecting the curvature operators of certain
symmetric spaces. Although the results of these two themes are different,
the underlying common feature is the reaction ODE which plays an important
role in both.
