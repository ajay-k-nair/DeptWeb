We discuss the notion of gap distributions of various
lists of numbers in [0, 1], in particular focusing on those which
are associated to certain low-dimensional dynamical systems.
We show how to explicitly compute some examples using techniques
of homogeneous dynamics. This works gives some possible notions of
`randomness' of special trajectories of billiards in polygons, and is based
partly on joint works with J. Chaika, J. Chaika and S. Leliever, and with
Y.Cheung.
