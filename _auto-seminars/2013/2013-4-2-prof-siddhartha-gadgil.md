The geometry of Metric spaces equipped with a probability measure
is a very dynamic field. One motivation for the study of such spaces is
that they are the natural limits of Riemannian manifolds in many contexts.

          In this talk, I will introduce basic properties of metric
measure spaces and the Gromov-Prohorov distance on them. I will also
discuss joint work with Manjunath Krishnapur in which we show that
independently sampling points according to the given measure gives an
asymptotically bi-Lipschitz  correspondence between Metric measure spaces
and Random matrices. Finally, I will briefly discuss work with Divakaran in
which we study the compactification of the Moduli space of Riemann surfaces
in terms of metric measure spaces.
