The aim of this thesis is to give explicit descriptions of the
set of proper holomorphic mappings between two complex manifolds
with reasonable restrictions on the domain and target spaces.
Without any restrictions, this problem is intractable even when
posed for domains in C^n. We present results for special classes
of manifolds. We study, broadly, two types of structure
results:
