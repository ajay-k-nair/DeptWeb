Many commonly used mixed finite elements for the Stokes problem
only conserve mass approximately. We show that if we supplement polynomial
basis functions with divergence free rational functions in the finite
element method we can conserve mass exactly. Similarly, we show how to
supplement polynomial basis in the finite element space with rational
functions in  when approximating linear elasticity problems in order to
preserve angular momentum exactly. This is joint work with Michael Neilan
(University of Pittsburgh).
