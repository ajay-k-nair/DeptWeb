The classical realization theorem gives various
characterizations of functions in the unit ball of $H^\infty(\mathbb
D)$, the bounded analytic functions on the unit disk $\mathbb D$, which
happens to also correspond to the multipliers of Hardy space
$H^2(\mathbb D)$.  This realization theorem yields an elegant way of
solving the Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation problem.  In the mid 80s, Jim
Agler discovered an analogue of the realization theorem over the
polydisk.  While for $d=2$, it once again gives a characterization of
the elements of the unit ball of $H^\infty(\mathbb D^d)$ (and so allows
one to solve interpolation problems in $H^\infty(\mathbb D^2)$), for
$d>2$, the class of functions which are realized is a proper subset of
the unit ball of $H^\infty(\mathbb D^d)$ --- the so-called Schur-Agler
class.
