Tits and Weiss in their book "Moufang Polygons" have conjectured
that the groups of rational points of certain forms of E_6 are
generated by some "inner" transformations. These groups occur as
groups of similitudes of certain cubic forms in 27 variables.
We will explain this conjecture and report on some results and reductions
towards a positive answer.
