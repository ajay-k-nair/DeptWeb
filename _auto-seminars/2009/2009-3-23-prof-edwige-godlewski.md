We are interested in deriving schemes having some 'well-balanced'
and 'asymptotic preserving' properties for the approximation of a
nonlinear
hyperbolic system with source term. In the case of Euler system with
friction, the scheme is derived from simple Riemann solvers or
equivalently using a relaxation scheme for the enlarged Euler system with
'potential'.
