Let H :R --> R. with multiple minima on R.For T> 0 consider the
probability measure on R with pdf proportional to exp(--H/T). In
this talk we  discuss the problem of weak limits of this measure as
T goes to infinity. It depends on the behaviour of H near its minima
locations. Both Gaussian and stable limit laws arise as weak limits.
