Let R be the reflection group of the complex leech lattice plus a
hyperbolic cell. Let D be the incidence graph of the projective plane
over the finite field with 3 elements. Let A(D) be the Artin group of
D: generators of A(D) correspond to vertices of D. Two generators
braid if there is an edge between them, otherwise they commute.
