       Title               :      Arithmeticity of complex hyperbolic
lattices.

       Dates            :       May 24 (Monday) and May 26 (Wednesday) 2010

       Time             :       4 to 5 p.m.

               Abstract
               --------
Since the discovery of non-arithmetic lattices in PU(2,1) by Mostow around
1980, very few examples have been constructed. By interpreting the Mostow
lattices in terms of monodromy groups of hypergeometric functions, Deligne
and Mostow were able to construct a few more non-arithmetic lattices in
PU(2,1) as well as a single example in PU(3,1), but no other examples have
been found since then. The goal of these lectures is to present a new class
of examples in PU(2,1), obtained in joint work with J. Parker and J.
Paupert.

In the first lecture, I will recall some general facts about the notion of
arithmeticity of lattices in semisimple Lie groups, its relation to
superrigidity and the known examples of non-arithmetic lattices in SO(n,1),
coming from Coxeter groups or from the Gromov/Piatetski-Shapiro
construction.

In the second lecture, I will briefly describe the geometry of complex
hyperbolic space, and explain the difficulties encountered when trying to
generalize the real hyperbolic constructions to the complex setting.
Finally, I will describe the new class of examples mentioned above, which
was obtained in part by a massive computer search.
