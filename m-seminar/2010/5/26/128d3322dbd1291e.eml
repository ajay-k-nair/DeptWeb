 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 --------<br>
Since the discovery of non-arithmetic lattices in PU(2,1) by Mostow around<=
br>
1980, very few examples have been constructed. By interpreting the Mostow<b=
r>
lattices in terms of monodromy groups of hypergeometric functions, Deligne<=
br>
and Mostow were able to construct a few more non-arithmetic lattices in<br>
PU(2,1) as well as a single example in PU(3,1), but no other examples have<=
br>
been found since then. The goal of these lectures is to present a new<br>
class of examples in PU(2,1), obtained in joint work with J. Parker and J.<=
br>
Paupert.<br>
<br>
In the first lecture, I will recall some general facts about the notion of<=
br>
arithmeticity of lattices in semisimple Lie groups, its relation to<br>
superrigidity and the known examples of non-arithmetic lattices in<br>
SO(n,1), coming from Coxeter groups or from the Gromov/Piatetski-Shapiro<br>
construction.<br>
<br>
In the second lecture, I will briefly describe the geometry of complex<br>
hyperbolic space, and explain the difficulties encountered when trying to<b=
r>
generalize the real hyperbolic constructions to the complex setting.<br>
Finally, I will describe the new class of examples mentioned above, which<b=
r>
was obtained in part by a massive computer search.<br>
