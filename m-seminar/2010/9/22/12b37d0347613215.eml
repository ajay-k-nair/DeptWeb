Title	: Projective Geometry and Holomorphic curves

Date	: September 22, 2010

Time	: 4:00 p.m.

Venue	: Lecture Hall III, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
A geometry is a collection of lines and points satisfying the usual
incidence axioms. By a theorem of Gromov, given an almost complex
structure (which is `tame')  on the complex projective plane CP^2,
we obtain a geometry by declaring appropriate  holomorphic curves
to be the lines. Ghys asked whether Desargues's  theorem (a Euclidean
geometry result related to symmetry) characterises the standard
complex structure. We show that this is indeed the case.

This talk is for the most part self-contained and elementary.
