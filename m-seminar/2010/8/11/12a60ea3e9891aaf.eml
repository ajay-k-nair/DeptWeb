Abstract:
   Why are soap bubbles spherical?  Why do double soap bubbles have the
shape that they do (three spherical caps meeting along a circle at 120
degree angles)?  The single bubble problem was solved in the 19th
century, and the double bubble problem was solved a few years ago.  The
analogous problem for triple soap bubbles remains a mystery.  We will
give an introduction to these problems and their solutions (when
known).

           All are Welcome.
