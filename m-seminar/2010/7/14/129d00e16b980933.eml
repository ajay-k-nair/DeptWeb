Abstract:
      It is very difficult in general to determine when a given compact
in C^n, n>1, is polynomially convex. In this talk, we shall discuss
polynomial convexity of some classes of sets. First, we shall
consider two totally-real surfaces in C^2 that contain the origin
and have distinct tangent planes there. We shall discuss how the
local polynomial convexity of the union of the tangent planes at
(0,0) influences local polynomial convexity of the union of the
surfaces at (0,0). Secondly, we will present a condition for local
polynomial convexity of unions of more than two totally-real planes
in C^2 containing the origin. Next, we shall talk about pluri-
subharmonicity. Using this notion we shall give a new proof of an
approximation theorem of Axler and Shields and also generalize it.
Polynomial convexity plays a very central role in our proof. Finally
we shall discuss a characterization for (large) compact patches of
smooth totally-real graphs in C^{2n} to be polynomially convex.

           All are Welcome.
