Dear Colleagues,

An informal Panel Discussion on Mathematics is being organized
on July 3. It will take place from 2.30 pm to 5pm at the Faculty
Hall of the Indian Institute of Science. A brief description
of it follows.

PERSPECTIVES ON INDIA'S MATHEMATICAL LANDSCAPE
(A panel discussion on diverse themes concerning  mathematics in India)

The panel will begin by discussing what constitutes mathematics and then
move on to talking about the history of Indian mathematics with emphasis
on the modern period - the twentieth century. This will be followed by
panelists giving their views on the current state of research in
mathematics. The pervasive influence of mathematics in practically every
human endeavour will be highlighted. Mathematics in the scientific milieu
will be yet another theme. Issues of mathematics education at the
undergraduate as well as school levels will also be covered. The
discussion will include a close look at India's place in the world of
mathematics as well as its role in promoting international cooperation in
mathematics. It will end with a brief description of the programme of the
forthcoming International Congress of Mathematicians in Hyderabad. The
audience will have opportunities to offer comments. The Panelists will
also field questions from the audience.

The Panelists are

M. S. Raghunathan, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research

R. Narasimha, Jawahar Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research

S. Shirali, Amber Valley Residential School

R.  Karandikar, Chennai Mathematical Institute

D. Singh, University of Delhi

R.  Ramachandran, The Hindu

On behalf of the Executive Organizing Committee of the International 
Congress of Mathematicians 2010, I am happy to invite you to attend  this
Panel Discussion and make the event a success.

With warm regards,

Gadadhar Misra
