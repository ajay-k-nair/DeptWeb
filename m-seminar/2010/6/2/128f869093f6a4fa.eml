Abstract:
      It is well known that there exist domains in C^n, n > 1, such that
all functions holomorphic therein extend holomorphically past the
boundary. In this talk, we shall examine this surprising phenomenon
by discussing refinements of the fundamental example of Hartogs. We
shall look at a generalization of Hartogs' construction discovered
by Chirka. Finally, we shall provide a partial answer to a related
question raised by Chirka.


           All are Welcome.
