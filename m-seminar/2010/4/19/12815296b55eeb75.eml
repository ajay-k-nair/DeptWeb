Abstract:
      This thesis considers two themes, both of
which emanate from and involve the Kobayashi and the
Carath\'{e}odory metric. First we study the biholomorphic
invariant introduced by B. Fridman on strongly pseudoconvex
domains, on weakly pseudoconvex domains of finite type in $\mathbf C^2$
and on convex finite type domains in $\mathbf C^n$ using the
scaling method. Applications include an alternate proof of the
Wong-Rosay theorem, a characterization of analytic polyhedra with
noncompact automorphism group when the orbit accumulates at a
singular boundary point and a description of the Kobayashi balls
on weakly pseudoconvex domains of finite type in $ \mathbf C^2$
and convex finite type domains in $ \mathbf C^n$ in terms of
Euclidean parameters. Second a version of Vitushkin's theorem
about the uniform extendability of a compact subgroup of
automorphisms of a real analytic strongly pseudoconvex domain is
proved for $C^1$-isometries of the Kobayashi and
Carath\'{e}odory metrics on a smoothly bounded strongly
pseudoconvex domain.
