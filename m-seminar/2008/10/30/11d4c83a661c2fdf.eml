=0A=
=0A=
About 1960 Tosio Kato, during his investigation of the evolution of=0A=
physical systems, was led to pose a key question about the square root of=
=0A=
non-symmetric elliptic partial differential operators in divergence form.=
=0A=
The one-dimensional problem was solved by Coifman, Meyer and myself in=0A=
1982, while it was only in 2001 that the question was fully answered by=0A=
Auscher, Hofmann, Lacey, Tchamitchian and myself. A more general viewpoint=
=0A=
was subsequently provided in joint work of mine with Axelsson and Keith.=0A=
=0A=
Recently, these ideas were employed to give conditions for the solvability=
=0A=
of non-symmetric elliptic partial differential equations with bounded=0A=
measurable coefficients and square integrable boundary values. I shall=0A=
survey these applications of harmonic analysis to the study of elliptic=0A=
pde's, and present a new approach of Auscher, Axelsson and myself.=0A=
