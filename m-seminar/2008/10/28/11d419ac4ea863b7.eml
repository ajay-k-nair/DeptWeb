Hi,=0A=
=0A=
=46rom November 03 - 07, 2008, from 11:30 AM to 1 PM,=0A=
Prof. Alan McIntosh of=0A=
Centre for Mathematics and its Applications, Australian National=0A=
University, Canberra=0A=
will speak on=0A=
The Square Root Problem of Kato for Elliptic Operators: Survey,=0A=
Solution and Sequel=0A=

Abstract=0A=
=0A=
About 1960 Tosio Kato, during his investigation of the evolution of=0A=
physical systems, was led to pose a key question about the square root=0A=
of non-symmetric elliptic partial differential operators in divergence=0A=
form. The one-dimensional problem was solved by Coifman, Meyer and=0A=
myself in 1982, while it was only in 2001 that the question was fully=0A=
answered by Auscher, Hofmann, Lacey, Tchamitchian and myself. A more=0A=
general viewpoint was subsequently provided in joint work of mine with=0A=
Axelsson and Keith.=0A=
=0A=
Recently, these ideas were employed to give conditions for the=0A=
solvability of non-symmetric elliptic partial differential equations=0A=
with bounded measurable coefficients and square integrable boundary=0A=
values. I shall survey these applications of harmonic analysis to the=0A=
study of elliptic pde's, and present a new approach of Auscher,=0A=
Axelsson and myself.=0A=
