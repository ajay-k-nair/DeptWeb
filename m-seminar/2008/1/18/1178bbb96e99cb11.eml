Abstract:
       Yang-Mills gauge theory, classical as well as quantum, in two
dimensions is both mathematically tractable and poses interesting
questions. The quantum theory for the field has a mathematically precise
formulation in terms of a Gaussian measure. Classical holonomies become
group-valued random variables in this setting.
       This talk will present an overview of some mathematical problems,
solutions, and ideas arising from two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory

                     All  interested  are  Welcome

                                                    CHAIRMAN
