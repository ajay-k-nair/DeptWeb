                               Abstract

Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) use signals generated by the brain to
directly control objects such as a cursor on a computer screen or a robot.
This mini-course will provide an introduction to current state-of-the-art
in this emerging field that lies at the intersection of neuroscience,
information technology, and robotics. We will seek to go beyond the recent
media hype about BCIs to achieve an in-depth understanding of what current
BCI systems can and cannot do. The course will explore BCI research along
several dimensions including: input signals (invasive versus non -
invasive recording techniques), feature extraction methods (spectral,
wavelet, etc.), machine learning for BCI (classification, regression,
etc.), and BCI applications (cursor control, word speller, robotic arm
control, etc.).No prior knowledge of neuroscience or machine learning is
required to attend this course.
