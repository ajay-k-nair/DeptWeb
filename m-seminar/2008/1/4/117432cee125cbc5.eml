                                  Abstract:


         Using what are called nonstandard finite models of differential
equations it is possible to greatly enhance the accuracy of finite
difference algorithms on a coarse grid without resorting to higher order
finite difference approximations. We show how to construct models, and use
them to solve some example problems in wave Propagation and scattering
