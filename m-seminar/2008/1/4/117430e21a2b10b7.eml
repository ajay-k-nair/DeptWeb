Abstract:
 	In the standard stochastic geometric setting, wireless networks can be 
modeled as point processes and their performances as certain mean functionals 
of the point process. Obtaining closed form expressions of such functionals is 
not easy for a general class of point processes. This motivates a comparative 
study. We study comparison of one such class of mean functionals - the additive 
and extremal shot-noise fields - which arise naturally in modeling of wireless 
networks, as ingredients of the so called Signal-to-Interference-Noise-Ratio.

To analyze them more rigorously, we make a comparative study of similar point 
processes (i.e, point processes with same number of points on a average but 
differing variances). More generally, we formulate a notion of comparison of 
random measures (measure-valued random variables) with point processes being 
nothing but random counting measures. Extensively using the theory of 
stochastic ordering, we show implications of this comparison on attraction or 
repulsion of points, shot-noise fields etc. The interesting examples are the 
ones that enable comparison of a clustered point processes with a homogeneous 
point process. Such examples shall be discussed.  This is an on-going joint 
work with Francois Baccelli and Bartek Blaszczyszyn.

                      All  interested  are  Welcome

                                                     CHAIRMAN
