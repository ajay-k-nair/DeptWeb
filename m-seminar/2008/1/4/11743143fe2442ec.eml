Abstract:
 	Let X be a compact complex manifold and let E be a holomorphic vector 
bundle on X. Any global holomorphic differential operator D on E induces an 
endomorphism of $\text{H}^{\bullet}(X,E)$. The super-trace of this endomorphism 
is the super-trace of D. This is a linear functional on the 0-th Hochschild 
homology of Diff(E), the algebra of global holomorphic differential operators 
on E.
 	While the Hochschild homology in the usual sense of Diff(E) is "too 
big" for explicit computation, there is a notion of completed Hochschild 
homology of Diff(E) with a very nice property: If HH_i(Diff(E)) denotes the 
i-th completed Hochschild homology, then HH_i(Diff(E)) is isomorphic to 
\text{H}^{2n-i}(X), the 2n-i th cohomology of X with complex coefficients. We 
shall attempt to outline how the supertrace mentioned above extends to a linear 
functional on the 0-th completed Hochschild homology of Diff(E), and thus, on 
H^{2n}(X). A priori, this linear functional depends on E. It however, can be 
shown that it is precisely the integral over X. This fact also helps one 
connect the "local Riemann-Roch theorems" of Nest-Tsygan to the Hirzebruch 
Riemann-Roch theorem. Analogous results about similar constructions using 
cyclic homology instead of Hochschild homology are also available.

                      All  interested  are  Welcome

                                                     CHAIRMAN
