Abstract:
 	Let X be a compact complex manifold and let E be a holomorphic 
vector bundle on X. Any global holomorphic differential operator D on E 
induces an endomorphism of $\text{H}^{\bullet}(X,E)$. The super-trace of 
this endomorphism is the super-trace of D. This is a linear functional on 
the 0-th Hochschild homology of Diff(E), the algebra of global holomorphic 
differential operators on E.
 	While the Hochschild homology in the usual sense of Diff(E) is 
"too big" for explicit computation, there is a notion of completed 
Hochschild homology of Diff(E) with a very nice property: If HH_i(Diff(E)) 
denotes the i-th completed Hochschild homology, then HH_i(Diff(E)) is 
isomorphic to \text{H}^{2n-i}(X), the 2n-i th cohomology of X with complex 
coefficients. We shall attempt to outline how the supertrace mentioned 
above extends to a linear functional on the 0-th completed Hochschild 
homology of Diff(E), and thus, on H^{2n}(X). A priori, this linear 
functional depends on E. It however, can be shown that it is precisely the 
integral over X. This fact also helps one connect the "local Riemann-Roch 
theorems" of Nest-Tsygan to the Hirzebruch Riemann-Roch theorem. Analogous 
results about similar constructions using cyclic homology instead of 
Hochschild homology are also available.

                      All  interested  are  Welcome

                                                     CHAIRMAN
