                                  Abstract
                                 ------------


An individual feels regret when he makes a choice that results in an
outcome worse than would have occurred had he made an alternative choice.
A feeling of rejoice occurs when the option chosen yields a more favorable
outcome than an alternative decision. Although the feelings of regret and
rejoice are part of the human experience, their roles in shaping decisions
have been widely debated. Do agents hedge their decisions prospectively,
anticipating regret and rejoice and taking these potential emotions into
account? In regret theory, regret and rejoice have been hypothesized to be
components that enter the evaluation of the utility of a lottery (Bell
1982, 1983; Loomes and Sugden 1982, 1987; Gilovich et al, 1998). Regret
theory has been invoked to explain seemingly suboptimal decision making in
many domains, such as healthcare, insurance purchases, and financial
investments.

To explore the neurobiology of regret and rejoice, we used fMRI to
investigate the neural bases of regret and rejoice with a non-monetary
medium. Incentives were created using painful outcomes in the form of mild
electrical shocks to the foot and the possibility of avoiding them. A key
component of regret theory is that the level of regret or rejoice an
individual experiences depends on the prior relative likelihood of the
eventual outcome. For example, winning from betting on a long-shot, even
if the outcome is the same, evokes more rejoice than winning a relatively
sure thing. Thus, we hypothesized that the neural response to a painful
outcome would also reflect the degree of regret as measured by theprior
probability of the outcome. Similarly, when an individual avoids a
potential shock, he would experience a degree of rejoice that correlates
with the probability he had of receiving the shock. We used data from
participants’ self-reported ratings, as well as data on their skin
conductance, to further support our finding that differing degrees of
regret and rejoice are distinguishable and reflected in physical response
measures.

Our fMRI results (Chandrasekhar et al. 2008) suggest that activation of a
cortical network, consisting of the medial orbitofrontal cortex, left
superior frontal cortex, right angular gyrus, and left thalamus,
correlates with the degree of regret. A different network, including the
rostral anterior cingulate, left hippocampus,   left   ventral   striatum,
  and   brainstem/midbrain   were   active   during   rejoice.   The
rightinferior orbitofrontal cortex, pre-supplementary motor area, anterior
cingulate, and posterior cingulate showed similar patterns of activation
with both regret and rejoice, suggesting that these regions may register
surprise from the realization of relatively unlikely events. Taken
together, these results show the   neurobiological   effect   of   ex-ante
probability  on   the   experience   of   regret   and   rejoice   and  
that distinct, but overlapping networks are involved in the two
experiences.
