Dear All,

   Title:  The balancing principle for the
           regularization of elliptic Cauchy problems

   Speaker: Prof. Sergei Pereverzyev
            Johann Radon Institute for Computational
            and  Applied Mathematics,  Austria

   Date and Time: 4 to 5 PM, 8th April (Tuesday)

    Venue: LH 1 Math Dept IISc


Abstract:
A classical ill-posed elliptic Cauchy problem is discussed. We consider
the reconstruction of the Dirichlet trace of the solution at the part of a
boundary where no data are available.  By natural linearization we
transform  it into a linear ill-posed operator equation. Discretization is
applied as a regularization method (also known as a self-regularization)
to obtain a stable approximate solution. Balancing principle as an
adaptive strategy is studied  to choose an appropriate discretization
level without quantitative knowledge  of a convergent rate or stability.
Numerical tests illustrate theoretical  results.
