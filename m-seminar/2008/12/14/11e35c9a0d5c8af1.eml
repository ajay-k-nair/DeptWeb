Abstract:
     Embedded contact homology (ECH) is an invariant of
three-manifolds due to Hutchings, Sullivan, and Taubes.  It uses a
contact structure on a three-manifold to produce an invariant of the
underlying topological manifold.  The invariant is the homology of a
chain complex generated by certain closed orbits of the Reeb vector
field (of interest in classical dynamics), whose differential counts
certain holomorphic curves in the symplectization of the contact
three-manifold.  Few nontrivial examples of ECH have been computed.
In this talk, I will give some background and context on ECH and then
describe the computation of the ECH of circle bundles over Riemann
surfaces, in which the relevant holomorphic curves are actually
meromorphic sections of complex line bundles.
