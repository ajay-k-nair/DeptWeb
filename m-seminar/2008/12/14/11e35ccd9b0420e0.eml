Abstract:
     Reflected diffusions arise in many contexts.
We identify a rather general condition under which these diffusions
belong to the class of so-called "Dirichlet processes", which
are a generalization of continuous semimartingales that admit
many nice properties, including an Ito formula.  We also provide
an example arising from applications, in which the reflected diffusion
fails to be a semimartingale, but belongs to the class of
Dirichlet processes.  This is partly based on joint work with
Weining Kang.
