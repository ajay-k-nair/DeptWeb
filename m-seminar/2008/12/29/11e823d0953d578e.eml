Abstract:
      I will introduce an exact stochastic representation for certain
   non-linear transport equations (e.g. 3D-Navier-Stokes, Burgers)
   based on noisy Lagrangian paths, and use this to construct a
   (stochastic) particle system for the Navier-Stokes equations. On any
   fixed time interval, this particle system converges to the
   Navier-Stokes equations as the number of particles goes to infinity.

   Curiously, a similar system for the (viscous) Burgers equations
   shocks almost surely in finite time. This happens because these
   particle systems exhibit a curious energy dissipation on long time
   intervals. I will describe a resetting procedure by which these
   shocks can (surprisingly!) be avoided, and thus obtain convergence
   to the viscous Burgers equations on long time intervals.

                        All  interested  are  Welcome
