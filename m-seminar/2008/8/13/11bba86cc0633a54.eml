Dear All,

As some of you might be aware I am offering a course on the `Arithmetic of
Dynamical Systems'. This is based on the the book of Silverman in the GTM
series. The course offers NO CREDIT towards anything but if you are
interested in number theory or algebraic geometry it might be of interest to
you.

Information about the contents of the book and the course can be found at

http://www.math.brown.edu/~jhs/ADSHome.html

The prerequisites for the course are basic algebra. You may have to learn
some basic algebraic number theory as the course goes on. The subject is
brand new to me and in fact I will also be learning it as we go along so its
not going to be like any of the other courses you are used to.  No
guarantees of anything.

The first lecture will be tomorrow - Thursday, 14th August -  at 2pm in TIFR
CAM. If there is sufficient interest from other institutions we can move the
lecture to Friday afternoons in TIFR Centre, IISc. Campus.

In any case, if you have the slightest of interest or know someone who has,
feel free to ask them to come and talk to me. Feel free to extend this
invitation to your friends and students in other institutions as well.

regards
