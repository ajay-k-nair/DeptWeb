Abstract:
 	We study the secondary structure of RNA determined by Watson-Crick
pairing without pseudo-knots using Milnor invariants of links. We
focus on the first non-trivial invariant, which can be interpreted in
terms of the Heisenberg group as well as lattice paths, which we call the
Heisenberg invariant.

We show that the Heisenberg invariant is related to a dynamically, hence
biologically, important property of RNA folding. Namely, if the Heisenberg
invariant in large, then there are widely separated local maxima for the
number of Watson-Crick pairs.
