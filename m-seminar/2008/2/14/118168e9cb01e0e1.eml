Title:   MATHEMATICAL MODELLING IN HEMODYNAMICS I

Date and Time: Friday, 15 February 2008,  4 to 5 pm

Venue: LH-1 , Math Dept

Abstract:

2D Mathematical model an numerical simulations of non-Newtonian shear depen=
dent=20
flow with fluid-structure interaction

We present a mathematical model for blood flow, which consists of the
interaction between vessel wall movement and the flow in a 2D channel with
constricted area of stenosis. The Newtonian, as well as two non-Newtonian
fluids are considered and compared in numerical experiments. For the
vessel wall deformation the generalized string equation for radial
symmetric tube is used and extended to a stenosed vessel. The global
iterative approach to approximate the fluid structure interaction is used.
Numerical methods implemented in UG software toolbox are described. Some
computational simulations and comparisons of special hemodynamical control
quantities, measuring the risk zones in blood vessel are shown and
discussed at the end.
