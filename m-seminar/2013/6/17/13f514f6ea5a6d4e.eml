Abstract:
Integral geometry is a field of mathematics that studies
inversions and various properties of transforms, which
integrate functions along curves, surfaces and hypersurfaces.
Such transforms arise naturally in numerous problems of
medical imaging, remote sensing, and non-destructive testing.
The most typical examples include the Radon transform and its
generalizations. The talk will discuss some problems and
recent results related to generalized Radon transforms, and
their applications to various problems of tomography.
