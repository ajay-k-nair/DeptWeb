Title   : Control of a queuing system under the moderate
          deviation scaling

Abstract:
In recent times, exponential type cost structure has become popular
in control theory. In this talk we formulate and discuss a risk-
sensitive type control problem for a multi-class queuing system under
the moderate deviation scaling. It is known that the rate function
corresponding to the moderate deviation scaling is of Gaussian type.
This property of the rate function is often useful for mathematical
analysis. We show that the limiting game corresponding to our control
problem is solvable. Also the limiting game has a similarity to the
well-studied Brownian control problems. This problem is also related to
a  conjecture of Damon Wischik (2001). The main difficulty in working
with G/G/1 queuing network is that the underlying state dynamics is not
Markov. Markov property has proven useful for these type of problems
(see e.g., Atar-Goswami-Shwartz(2012)). The standard way to solve these
problems is to look at the pde associated with the state dynamics and
sandwich the limiting value between the upper and lower value of the
game. This technique does not work when the state dynamics is not Markov.
We will see that the special structure of the rate function and moderate
deviation settings will be helpful to overcome such difficulties.
Extension to many-server models will also be discussed.

Part of this talk is a joint work with Prof. Rami Atar, Technion.
