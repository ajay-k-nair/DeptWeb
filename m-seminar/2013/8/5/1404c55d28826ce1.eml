Dear All,



                       Department of Mathematics
                Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                        SEMINAR

Speaker:   Prof. Jayadev Athreya
                     University of Illiniois, Urbana-Champaign

Title: Gap Distributions and Homogeneous Dynamics

Date:   August 5th, 2013 (Monday)

Time:   3:30- 4:30pm

Venue:   Department of Mathematics, LH-I



Abstract: We discuss the notion of gap distributions of various
lists of numbers in [0, 1], in particular focusing on those which
are associated to certain low-dimensional dynamical systems.
We show how to explicitly compute some examples using techniques
of homogeneous dynamics. This works gives some possible notions of
`randomness' of special trajectories of billiards in polygons, and is based
partly on joint works with J. Chaika, J. Chaika and S. Leliever, and with
Y.Cheung.

            ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED,




                                            Chairman,
                                            Department of Mathematics
