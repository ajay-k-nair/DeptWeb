Dear all,



                           Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                  SEMINAR


Speaker : Prof Nikhil Srivastava
                  Microsoft research, India

Title    : Mixed Characteristic Polynomials and the Kadison-Singer Problem

Date    : Aug 23, 2013 (Friday)

Time    : 2:00 - 4:00 p.m.

Venue  : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:

The Kadison-Singer problem is a question in operator theory which arose in
1959 while trying to make Dirac's axioms for quantum mechanics
mathematically rigorous. Over the course of several decades, this question
was reduced to several equivalent conjectures about finite matrices, and
shown to have significant implications in applied mathematics, computer
science, and various branches of pure mathematics.

I will describe a recent proof of a strong form of the conjecture. The
proof is based on a new method which relies on analyzing the expected
characteristic polynomials of sums of independent rank one matrices, which
we call 'mixed characteristic polynomials'. The talk will be mostly
elementary, relying mainly on simple tools from the theory of real stable
polynomials.

Joint work with Adam Marcus (Yale) and Daniel Spielman (Yale).

                      ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED,


Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
