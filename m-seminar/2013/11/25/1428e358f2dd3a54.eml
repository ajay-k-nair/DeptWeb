Dear all,

                           Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR


Speaker : Prof Apoorva Khare
                      Stanford university

Title   : Preserving positivity for rank-constrained matrices

Date    : 28th Nov, 2013 (Thursday)

Time    : 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics


Abstract:
We study the problem of characterizing functions, which when applied
entrywise, preserve Loewner positivity on distinguished submanifolds of
the cone of positive semidefinite matrices. Following the work of
Schoenberg and Rudin (and several others), it is well-known that entrywise
functions preserving positivity in all dimensions are necessarily
absolutely monotonic. However, there are strong theoretical and practical
motivations to study functions preserving positivity in a fixed dimension
$n$. Such characterizations are known only in the $n=2$ case.

In joint work with D. Guillot and B. Rajaratnam (Stanford), we study a
further refinement of the problem via rank constraints. Specifically, we
characterize the functions which send positive semidefinite $n \times n$
matrices of rank at most $l$ to matrices of rank at most $k$, for various
$1 \leq k,l \leq n$ and under mild differentiability assumptions. As a
special case, we provide an elementary proof of the above classical result
by Rudin et al.

This talk will be accessible to a general mathematics audience and graduate
students should be able to follow much of it.


All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
