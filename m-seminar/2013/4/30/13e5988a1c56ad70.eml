 Abstract:-
A robust, inexpensive, general-purpose CFD algorithm of better than
second-order accuracy would have transformative impact on scientific
computing. This talk will describes progress toward this objective.

“Active flux” schemes are finite-volume schemes in which the interface
fluxes are independent degrees of freedom, rather than being interpolated
from the cell averages. This both doubles the effective resolution of a given
grid, and raises the default order of accuracy from two to three. Such a
scheme was actually proposed by van Leer in 1977, although its merits went
largely unrecognized for many years. We have recently brought this method
to the point of solving both linear advection and linear acoustic problems to
third-order on arbitrary unstructured grids in any number of dimensions.

On simplicial grids, a conservative mean value is stored for each cell and
non-conservative degrees of freedom are held to reside at cell vertices and
edge mid-points, allowing a local quadratic reconstruction that is
independent
of neighboring cells. This reconstruction defines the contribution that
this cell
makes to the update of each such degree of freedom. In the case of advection,
this contribution is defined by interpolation within the cell determined
by the
backward-drawn characteristic. In the case of an acoustic problem, this
update
is obtained from the method of spherical means, which is a truly
multidimensional
method of upwinding. The cell average can now be obtained by integrating
around
the boundary, which gains one order of accuracy over that of the
reconstruction.
The linear Euler equations can be solved by operator-splitting without
loss of
accuracy. Current effort is focused on nonlinear aspects including
limiting. We also
give preliminary results from a fifth-order scheme.

            ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED,
