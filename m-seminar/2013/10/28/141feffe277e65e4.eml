Dear all,

                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                 COLLOQUIUM


Speaker : Prof Manish Kumar
                 ISI Bangalore

Title   : On Abhyankar's inertia conjecture

Date    : 8th Nov, 2013 (Friday)

Time    : 4:00 - 5:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
The conjecture is about various subgroup that can occur as
the inertia subgroup of an etale Galois cover of an affine line at a
point above infinity over an algebraically closed field of positive
characteristic. I will explain this conjecture and mention some
positive results supporting this conjecture.

                        ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED

Chairman,
