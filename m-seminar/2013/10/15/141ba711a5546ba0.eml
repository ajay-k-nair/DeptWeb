Dear all,


                           Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    COLLOQUIUM


Speaker:      Prof C S Aravinda
                            TIFR Bangalore

Title:          Homotopy type and volume of locally symmetric spaces


Date :       23rd October, 2013 (Wednesday)

Time :       3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue :     Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics


Abstract:    A conjecture of Gelander states that there is an effective
triangulation in a compact deformation retract of a given locally symmetric
space, giving linear bounds on the full homotopy type. This talk will explain
some of this construction.



                 ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED



Chairman,
Department of Mathematics.
