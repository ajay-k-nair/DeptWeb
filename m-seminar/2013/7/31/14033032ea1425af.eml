Title   : Weak solutions and convergence analysis of numerical methods
           for coagulation-fragmentation equations

Date    : August 7, 2013

Time    : 4:00 - 5:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics


Abstract:
In this talk I will mainly focus on the existence and uniqueness
of weak solutions to the nonlinear continuous coagulation and multiple
fragmentation equations. In addition, the convergence analysis of two
numerical methods (the fixed pivot technique and the cell average
technique) for solving nonlinear coagulation or Smoluchowski equation
is introduced. At the end, the convergence rates obtained from both the
techniques are compared and mathematical results of the convergence
analysis are also demonstrated numerically.
