Title   : A-infinity algebras and the homotopy transfer theorem II

Abstract:
We will continue our discussion of the Homotopy Transfer Theorem
for A-infinity algebras.  We will introduce the notion of a minimal model
for a dg algebra.  This will allow us to relate quasi-isomorphisms between
strict dg algebras and quasi-isomorphisms between A-infinity algebras.

Under certain hypotheses, the Homotopy Transfer Theorem can be used to
construct minimal models. An early appearance of this construction can be
found in the Rational Homotopy Theory of Quillen and Sullivan.

                      ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED
