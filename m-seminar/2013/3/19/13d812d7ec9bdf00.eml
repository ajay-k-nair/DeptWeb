Dear all,


                    Department of Mathematics
                       Indian Institute of Science
                                 Bangalore

                  ----------------------------

Speaker: Dr. Dhanya
               IISc Bangalore

Title: On the variational methods for nonlinear elliptic PDE's

Day : Wednesday (starting from March 20th, 2013)

Time: 11.00 AM-12.15 PM

Venue : LH-III, Department of mathematics

Abstract:
We will introduce the concept of critical point theory for nonlinear
elliptic PDE's and discuss variational methods like mountain pass theorem
(more generally what are known as min-max methods) in proving existence of
critical points of functionals defined on Banach space.


          All are cordially invited,


                                                      Chairman,
                                             Department of Mathematics.
