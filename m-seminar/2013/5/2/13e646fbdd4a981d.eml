Title:   Differential Modular forms on Shimura curves
                 over totally real fields

Venue:   Department of Mathematics, LH-III

 Abstract:-
 In this talk, we will introduce the theory of differential modular forms
 for compact Shimura curves over totally real fields. These are the
modular forms obtained by applying the arithmetic jet space functor
(adjoint to the Witt vector functor) to the ring of modular forms
(global sections of certain line bundle). We will show that these
differential modular forms help us to detect the ordinary quaternionic
abelian schemes and schemes with Frobenius lifts (local analogue
of CM abelian schemes). These are also useful to understand the
categorical quotient of Shimura curves modulo Hecke
correspondences/isogeny. We also construct the Serre-Tate
expansions of such differential modular forms  as a possible
alternative to the Fourier expansion maps.
