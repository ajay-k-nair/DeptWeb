Title : Renormalization and reverse renormalization in the dynamics of
germs of holomorphic diffeomorphisms in C.

Date : 17th May  2013

Time: 11-12 AM.

Place:  LH 3  IISc Mathematics Department

Abstract: We discuss the renormalization and reverse renormalization
constructions used in studying the dynamics of germs of holomorphic
diffeomorphisms fixing the origin in C with linear part a rotation. Such a
germ is said to be linearizable if it is analytically conjugate to its
linear part.

Renormalization was first used in this setting by Yoccoz to give a
geometric proof sufficiency of the Brjuno condition (an arithmetic
condition ensuring that the rotation number does not admit very good
rational approximations) for linearizability. It was later used by
Perez-Marco to obtain a similar linearization result for germs without
periodic orbits accumulating the fixed point.

We explain how renormalization can be adapted to the setting of commuting
germs in order to obtain a multi-variable Brjuno type arithmetic condition
for linearizability of commuting germs.

Reverse renormalization was also first used by Yoccoz to construct
non-linearizable germs demonstrating the optimality of the Brjuno
condition for linearizability. It was also used later by Perez-Marco to
prove optimality of his arithmetic condition for linearizability without
periodic orbits, and to construct examples of germs with uncountable
centralizers. A key point in his method was the introduction of Riemann
surfaces called tube-log Riemann surfaces in the construction. Cheritat
added a new ingredient to this construction, namely the use of Runge's
Theorem, which made the construction flexible enough to construct
invariant continua with pathological topologies.

We explain how this reverse renormalization can be used to construct
hedgehogs such that the fixed point is inaccessible from the complement,
answering a question of Perez-Marco's.
