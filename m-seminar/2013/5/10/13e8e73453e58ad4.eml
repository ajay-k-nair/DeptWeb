Title: "Gradient bounds for p-harmonic systems with vanishing
Neumann data in a  convex domain"

Time : 11am

Venue: Department of Mathematics, LH-1

Abstract: "Let u be a weak solution to a p-harmonic system with vanishing
Neumann data on a portion of the boundary of a  domain  which is  convex.
We show that  subsolution type  arguments for  some  uniformly elliptic
PDE's can be used to deduce that  the modulus of the gradient is bounded
depending on  the Lipschitz character  of the domain. In this context, I
would like to mention that classical  results  on the boundedness of the
gradient require the domain to be  C^{1, Dini}. However,  in our case,
since the domain is convex, one can make use of the fundamental inequality
of Grisvard  which can be thought of as an analogue of the use of the
barriers for Dirichlet problems in convex domains. Our arguments  replaces
an argument  based on level sets in recent important works of Mazya,
Cianchi-Mazya and Geng-Shen involving similar problems. I also  intend to
indicate some open problems in the regularity theory of degenerate elliptic
and parabolic systems. This is  a joint work with Prof. John L. Lewis. "
