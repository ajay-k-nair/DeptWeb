Abstract:
(Bio)chemical reaction networks are used in systems biology to model
gene regulatory, protein, metabolic, and other cellular networks. Since
existence of multiple steady states (MSS) provides the underpinnings for
switching in chemical reaction networks, it is a fundamental problem to
determine which network structures permit MSS. There exist several
criteria which, when satisfied, establish that a network does not permit
MSS  regardless of the parameter values. On the other hand, results that
establish that a network does permit MSS are rare. I will describe our
recent work which provides a novel approach towards solving this
problem. In the second part of the talk, I will describe stochastic
switching which occurs in a network of neurons which is responsible for
the distinct brain states of sleep and wake and for the transitions
between the two states.



            ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED,
