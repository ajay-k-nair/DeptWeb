Dear all,


                    Department of Mathematics
                       Indian Institute of Science
                                 Bangalore
                    ------------------------

Prof Ritabrata Munshi from TIFR, Mumbai will give a
series of lecture on "Maass forms with a focus on the
conjectures of Ramanujan and Selberg".

Schedule for the lectures:

Feb   18th, 20th and 22nd, 2013 (Mon, Wed and Fri)   4-5pm
in LH-1, Department of mathematics.

Feb   19th and 21st, 2013 (Tue, Thu) 11:00-12:00
in LH-111, Department of mathematics.

Abstract:
This series of lectures will be on Automorphic forms for discrete
subgroups of
SL(2,R). We will start with a quick overview of the classical modular
forms, and
then slowly move  on to Maass forms. Among other things we will cover the
theory of Hecke operators, Fourier coefficients of the Hecke eigenforms,
Spectral
theory of the Laplacian, and the Trace formula.  The main focus will be on
the
conjecture of Ramanujan regarding the size of Fourier coefficients and the
(related) conjecture of Selberg on the smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian.

              All are cordially invited,


                                                      Chairman,
                                             Department of Mathematics.
