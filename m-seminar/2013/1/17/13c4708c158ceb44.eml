Dear All,

                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                        COLLOQUIUM

Speaker : Prof. Suhas Jaykumar Pandit
                                ICTP, Trieste

Title : The complex of  HNN-extensions  associated to  the free group of
rank n

Date : January 17th, 2013 (Thursday)

Time: 3.30 pm -4.30 pm

Venue: Department of Mathematics, LH-111

Abstract:  In this talk,  we shall discuss the complex of HNN - extensions
associated to the free group F_n  of finite rank n.   We shall sketch a
proof the following result " The group of simplicial automorphisms  of this
complex is isomorphic to the group Out(F_n) of outer automorphisms  of the
free group F_n of rank n.




            ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED,




                                            Chairman,
                                            Department of Mathematics
