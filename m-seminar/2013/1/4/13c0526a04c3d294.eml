Title: Rigidity and Regularity of Holomorphic Mappings

Date: 7th Jan, 2013 (Monday)

Venue: Department of Mathematics, LH III

Time: 4 - 5pm


Abstract:
This talk will be on two themes that illustrate the rigidity and
regularity of holomorphic mappings. The first part will deal with
results concerning the smoothness of continuous CR (Cauchy -- Riemann)
mappings; in particular, that of Lipschitz continuous CR mappings from
h-extendible/semi-regular hypersurfaces into certain Levi co-rank one
hypersurfaces, in C^n. The second part will deal with the classification
of Kobayashi hyperbolic, finite type rigid polynomial domains with  abelian
automorphism group in C^3.

               All are cordially invited,

Faculty members and students of the department are requested to attend.
