Title: Derived Geometry and Topological String Theory

Abstract.

The premise that "isomorphism" is a better behaved notion than
"equality" leads naturally to the notion of a higher category, and to
a paradigm where homotopy types replace sets as the basic building
blocks of mathematical structures. Derived geometry is geometry in
this homotopical context. This talk will be an introduction to
higher category theory and derived geometry, with an emphasis on their
essential role in the formulation of physical laws.


Topological string theory serves as an illustration of these ideas.
Boundary conditions (branes) in topological string theory are
naturally organized into higher categories. We will see how derived
algebraic geometry provides a natural framework in which to construct
moduli spaces of branes. These moduli spaces are a common
generalization and enhancement of various classical moduli spaces,
such as the moduli of holomorphic vector bundles on a Kahler manifold,
the moduli of representations of a quiver, and the moduli of
Lagrangian submanifolds in a symplectic manifold.


             All are cordially invited,


                                                      Chairman,
                                             Department of Mathematics.
