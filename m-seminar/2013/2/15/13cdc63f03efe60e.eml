Title    :   Solutions for differential equations in fluid mechanics by
different techniques

Abstract:
Any real physical problem arising in fluid mechanics, when it is
translated to mathematical approach generally govern a differential
equation with some assumptions.  The solution for such a study of the
system is solved using analytical or numerical techniques.  An attempt has
been made to understand the characteristics or behavior or analysis of the
physical system using different methods like Lighthill’s method,
perturbation methods, rational approximation or Padé approximation,
shooting technique and also highlights on the advantages and limitations
of each method are discussed.


            ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED,
