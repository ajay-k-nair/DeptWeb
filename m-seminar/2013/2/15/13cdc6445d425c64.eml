Abstract:
Let H be a separable Hilbert space over the complex field. The
class $$ {{\bold{S}}} := \lbrace N|_{M} : N \mbox{ is normal on H and M is
an invariant subspace for $N$} \rbrace$$ of operators was introduced by
Halmos and consists of subnormal operators. Each subnormal operator
possesses a unique minimal normal extension $\hat{N}$  as shown by Halmos.
Halmos proved that $\sigma(\hat{N}) \subseteq \sigma( {S})$ and then Bram
proved that $\sigma({S})$ is obtained by filling certain number of holes
in the spectrum $\sigma(\hat{N})$ of the minimal normal extension
$\hat{N}$ of a subnormal operator S.

 Let $\sigma_{\perp}(S) := \sigma(\hat{N})$ be the spectrum of the
minimal normal extension $\hat{N}$ of $S,$ which is called the normal
spectrum of a subnormal operator $S.$ This notion is due to Abrahamse and
Douglas.  We give several well-known characterization of subnormality. Let
$C^*(S_1)$ and $C^*(S_2)$ be the $C^{*}-$algebras generated by $S_{1}$ and
$S_{2}$ respectively, where $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ are bounded operators on
$H.$

 Next we give a characterization for subnormality which is purely
$C^{*}$-algebraic. We also establish an intrinsic characterization of the
normal spectrum for a subnormal operator, which enables us to answer the
following two questions.

Let $\Pi $ be a $^{*}$-representation from  $C^*(S_1)$ onto $C^*(S_2)$
such that $\Pi (S_{1})  = S_{2}.$

1. If $S_{1}$ is subnormal, then does it follow that $S_{2}$
 is subnormal?

2.  What is the relation between $\sigma_{\perp}{(S_{1})}$ and
$\sigma_{\perp}{(S_{2})}$?


The first question was asked by Bram and second was asked by Abrahamse and
Douglas. Answers to these questions were given by Bunce and Deddens.

      ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED,

Faculty members and students of the department are requested to attend.
