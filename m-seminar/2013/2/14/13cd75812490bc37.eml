Title: Geometrical shock dynamics and Shock vortex interaction

Recent investigations of shock boundary layer interaction reveal that the
reflected shock is being subjected to perturbations from the turbulent
boundary
layer and is prone to oscillations. To study the shock oscillations, we
propose to
examine the propagation of disturbances along a stationary oblique shock upon
interaction with a two-dimensional vortex. We study the decay of disturbances
along a normal shock upon its interaction with a vortex as measured from the
Euler computations. We use the theory of Geometrical shock dynamics (GSD)
which is a semi empirical theory that predicts the behavior of shock
propagation
into a stationary medium, to study the long range effects. With a required
reformulated version of GSD, we study the shock-vortex interaction problem
especially to observe the long range e&#64256;ects of the disturbances
that propagate
along the shock. Qualitative comparison between GSD and Euler computations
has been made. The wave structure of the disturbance resembles two different
types of N waves, the decay of which follows a power law profile. A
preliminary
extension of GSD to look for disturbances along shock surfaces in 3-D
flows has
been formulated.

          All are cordially invited,


                                                      Chairman,
                                             Department of Mathematics.
