Dear all,

                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : Prof Sumanta Sarkar

Title   : Constructions of Boolean Functions that are Significant in
Cryptography and Coding Theory

Date    : 20th Jan, 2014 (Monday)

Time    : 4:00 - 5:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract: A Boolean function is a mapping from the set of all binary
n-tuples to the set {0, 1}. Boolean functions are important building
blocks in designing secure cryptosystems known as stream ciphers. Boolean
functions also form an important class of linear codes, known as the
Reed-Muller codes. Over the last few decades, a lot of research has been
done on Boolean function for its applications in cryptography and coding
theory.

In this talk, I will demonstrate my contributions in the literature of
Boolean functions which are significant in cryptography and coding theory.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
