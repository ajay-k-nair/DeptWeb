Title   : Policy improvement algorithm for zero sum two person stochastic
games of perfect information in Cesaro payoffs.

Abstract: If the data defining a problem and at least one solution to the
problem lie in the same Archimedean ordered  field induced by the  data, 
we say that the problem has order field property.
When this property holds one may hope to do  only finitely many 
arithmetic operations on the data to arrive at one such a solution.  For
example if we start with rational data, the value and a pair of optimal
strategies for the players in a zero sum two person game have rational
entries.  This was first noticed by Herman Weyl , and it was a precursor
to solving them via  the simplex method. For bimatrix games while  Nash
exhibited an equilibrium in mixed strategies, it was Vorobev  and Kuhn who
checked that  the order field property holds for bimatrix games. Later
Lemke and Howson gave the so called linear complementarity  algorithm to
locate an  equilibrium pair in the same data field. For three  person
games,  Nash with Shapley constructed simple counter examples for lack of
order field property.  In general  stochastic games fail to have order
field property.

In our search for finite arithmetic step algorithms for stochastic games ,
perfect information stochastic games and more generally ARAT games stand
out for their simplicity of optimal  strategies .  While we know that they
have order field property,  the key issue is  how to adapt the  policy
improvement algorithm of  Markov decision processes to stochastic games. 
We  show how to extend this algorithm for zero sum two person stochastic
games of perfect  information in discounted as well as Cesaro average
payoffs and  show how one avoids cycling.


All are cordially invited!
