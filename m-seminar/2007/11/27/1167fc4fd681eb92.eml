Abstract:
 	The purpose of the talk will be to discuss the problem about
classifying domains in C^n that have a non-compact group of holomorphic
automorphisms. Examples and a flavour of some of the techniques that have
been successful so far will be provided.

                      All  interested  are  Welcome
