Subject: Fwd: Seminar Tomorrow


Hi

This is just to remind you that the Geometry Seminar will start
tomorrow, the 10th of August at 2pm -  in the TIFR Centre, IISc.
Campus.

The first talk will be given by me - Ramesh Sreekantan, TIFR.

Higher order modular forms -

Abstract : The notion of a higher order modular form was perhaps
introduced by Poincare or Eichler, but in its modern form was
introduced by Goldfeld around 12 years ago, in order to study a
conjecture of Spziro. While classical modular forms are initimately
related to the homology of the modular curves it appears that these
higher order forms are related to the homotopy groups of modular
curves. In this talk we will introduce these forms are discuss some
results on the structure of spaces of such forms.

Forthcoming speakers....
17 Aug - Prakash Belkale, UNC
24 Aug - Amritanshu Prasad, IMSc.
31 Aug - Vijay Patankar, MSRI
7 Sept - G.V. Ravindra, IISc.
14 Sept - N. Tejaswi, IISc.

after that it is open, but some people have offered to speak - J.
Biswas, D. Pancholi....
Please let me know if you would like to talk.

Ramesh
