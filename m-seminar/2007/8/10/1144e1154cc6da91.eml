Abstract:
 	Hyperbolic balance laws with source terms allow non-unique entropy 
solutions.  By taking the source term as a variable and stating its time 
derivative to be zero, a balance law can be rewritten in a quasi-linear form. 
This then reveals the loss of strict hyperbolicity at critical states, the so 
called resonance phenomenon. Numerical schemes are sensitive to this phenomenon 
and it is uncertain, which entropy solution (if it is non-unique) will be 
created by an appropriate numerical scheme.
 	In this talk, the concept of path conservative schemes will be used to 
show, that different choices of paths can lead to different solutions. 
Furthermore, in the same spirit, physically motivated parabolic regularization 
will be used, to show, that even vanishing viscosity solutions can give 
different answers depending on the rate of vanishing regularization.
