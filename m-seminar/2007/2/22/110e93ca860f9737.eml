      Abstract:
          Let $k$ be a field of characteristic not 2 and $G$ be an 
algebraic group defined over $k$. An element $t$ in $G(k)$ is called real 
if there exists $g\in G(k)$ such that $gtg^{-1}=t^{-1}$. An element $t\in 
G(k)$ is called strongly real if $t=\tau_1\tau_2$ where $\tau_i\in G(k)$ 
and $\tau_i^2=1$. We discuss when a semisimple real element is strongly 
real in $G(k)$. We investigate this question for classical groups and the 
groups of type $G_2$ in detail.
