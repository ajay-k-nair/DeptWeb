      Abstract:
          Let $k$ be a field of characteristic not 2 and $G$ be an algebraic 
group defined over $k$. An element $t$ in $G(k)$ is called real if there exists 
$g\in G(k)$ such that $gtg^{-1}=t^{-1}$. An element $t\in G(k)$ is called 
strongly real if $t=\tau_1\tau_2$ where $\tau_i\in G(k)$ and $\tau_i^2=1$. We 
discuss when a semisimple real element is strongly real in $G(k)$. We 
investigate this question for classical groups and the groups of type $G_2$ in 
detail.
