Abstract:
 	String theorists believe that elementary particles can be
    described by one dimensional string-like objects that propagate in
    certain geometries. An appropriate mathematical treatment combines the
    study of quantum field theory and geometry. Whether or not one
    believes in the physical (or even mathematical) reality of string
    theory as a whole, the idea to use one-dimensional "test particles" to
    investigate the properties of interesting geometries allows far
    reaching insights- both in quantum field theory and in geometry.

    The talk will present down-to-earth examples of this phenomenon,
    where in fact the rather rich structure of quantum field theory serves
    as an aid to geometers.

                      All  interested  are  Welcome

                                                     CHAIRMAN
