Speaker		: Mainak Poddar
 		  ISI Kolkata

Title		: How interesting are orbifolds?

Day & date	: Friday, March 23, 2007

Time		: 4:00 p.m.

Venue		: Lecture Hall - I
 		  Department of Mathematics


Abstract:

Orbifolds are generally regarded as generalizations of manifolds.
On the other hand, finite groups are also orbifolds. In this survey
talk, I will focus on how orbifolds appear naturally in some
important areas of Mathematics and Physics. I will also describe
some features of the geometry of orbifolds.

 		All interested are welcome
