Abstract:
 	In this lecture I will give a brief survey on the well-known
Zariski-Lipman Conjecture which is still open in general. However,
there are some partial results have been proved. I will state these
results by giving necessary definitions and concepts required.

                      All  interested  are  Welcome

                                                             CHAIRMAN
