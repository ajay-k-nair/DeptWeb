Abstract:
 	We consider a point process sequence induced by a stationary symmetric 
-stable (0 < < 2) discrete parameter random eld. It is easy to prove, following 
the arguments in the one-dimensional case in Resnick and Samorodnitsky (2004), 
that if the random eld is generated by a dissipative group action then the 
point process sequence converges weakly to a cluster Poisson process. For the 
conservative case, no general result is known even in the one-dimensional case. 
We look at a specic class of stable random elds generated by conservative 
actions whose eective dimensions can be computed using the structure theorem of 
nitely generated abelian groups. The corresponding point processes sequence is 
not tight and hence needs to be properly normalized in order to ensure weak 
convergence. This weak limit is computed using extreme value theory and some 
counting techniques. (This talk is based on a joint work with Gennady 
Samorodnitsky)
