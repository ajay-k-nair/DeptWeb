Abstract:
 	We show that Trepreau's theorem (minimality of a hypersurface at a 
point implies one sided extension of all CR functions) does not hold if 
the hypersurface is allowed to have singularities. We formulate a 
geometric condition called two sided support which is the obstruction to 
such extension.
