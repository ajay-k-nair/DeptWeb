Abstract:
 	Informally, the ``zero-range'' particle system follows a collection of 
dependent random walks on a lattice, each of which interacts infinitesimally 
only with those particles already present at its location.
 	In this talk, we consider the asymptotics of a distinguished, or tagged 
particle in this interacting particle system.  In particular, we discuss a 
``nonequilibrium'' invariance principle, in one dimension when the transition 
rates are mean-zero, with respect to a diffusion whose coefficients depend on 
the ``hydrodynamic'' density.


                      All  interested  are  Welcome

                                                             CHAIRMAN
