    Abstract:
 	A family of elliptic curves (or an elliptic surface) is given by a 
Weierstrass equation

 	E_t : y^2= x^3+ A(t)x + B(t),

where A(t) and B(t) are polynomials. Little is known about the rational 
points on such families. However there are interesting predictions. For 
example, a conjecture of Mazur states that if one fiber E_t has infinite 
number of rational points, then there is a dense set of fibers with 
infinite number of rational points. In the special case when deg A<= 4 and 
deg B<= 6, there is a more precise conjecture of Manin about the number of 
rational points of a fixed height. In this talk I will describe recent 
results towards these conjectures. I will also discuss other open problems 
regarding distribution of Mordell-Weil ranks.


                      All  interested  are  Welcome

                                                     CHAIRMAN
