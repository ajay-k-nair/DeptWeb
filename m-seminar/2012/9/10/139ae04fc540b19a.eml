Title   :  Pricing Credit Derivatives in a Markov Modulated Market.

Abstract: Credit risk refers to the potential losses that can arise due to
the changes in the credit quality of financial instruments. There are two
approaches to pricing credit derivatives, namely the structural and the
reduced form or intensity based models.  In the structural approach
explicit assumptions are made about the dynamics of a firm's assets, its
capital structure, debt and share holders. A firm defaults when its asset
value reaches a certain lower threshold, defined endogenously within the
model. In the intensity based approach the firm's asset values and its
capital structure are not modelled at all. Instead the dynamics of default
are exogenously given through a default rate or intensity.

Some models have been studied in this regard which can
capture the feedback in case of a major credit event. We extend the
research in the same direction by proposing a new family of models having
the feedback phenomena and capturing the effects of regime
switching economy on the market. The regime switching economy is
modeled by a continuous time Markov chain. We model the default
intensity in a pool of firms using the Markov chain and a risk factor
process. We price some single-name and multi-name credit derivatives in
terms of certain transforms of the default process. We show that the
pricing formulas in our model are computationally tractable. We show that
our model can easily incorporate the effects of business cycle. We
demonstrate the impact on spreads of the inclusion of rare states that
attempt to capture a tight liquidity situation.
