Title    :   Affine Stratification Number and Moduli Space of Curves

Date     :   December 19, 2012 (Wednesday)

Time     :   4:00 pm- 5:00pm

Venue    :   Department of Mathematics, LH-I

Abstract:
The affine stratification number of a variety is a measure of how far a
variety is from being affine and how close it is to being projective. I
shall talk about a certain filtration on the moduli space of curves and
the affine stratification number of the open sets occurring in the
filtration. This will lead to some cohomology computations where we shall
make use of the natural operad structure on the homology of the moduli
spaces as well as the some mixed hodge theory.


            ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED,




                                            Chairman,
