Abstract:
Conformal field theories (CFTs) are related (in Mathematics) to algebraic
geometry, infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and probability, and (in
Physics) to critical phenomena and string theory. From a mathematical
point of view, much of the formalisation has been from the point
of view of algebra -- in fact using formal power series. I will give a
denition of the simplest "chiral" or "holomorphic" CFT using elementary
function theory. If time permits, I will also explain operator product
expansions.
