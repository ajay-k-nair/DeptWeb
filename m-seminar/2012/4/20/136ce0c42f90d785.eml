Abstract:
Recently, the financial world witnessed a series of major defaults by
several institutions and banks. Therefore, it is not at all surprising
that credit risk analysis has turned out to be one of the most important
aspects of study in the finance community. As credit derivatives are long
term instruments, they are affected by the changes in the market
conditions. Thus, it is appropriate to take into consideration the
cyclical effects of the market. This thesis addresses some of the
important issues in credit risk analysis for a regime-switching market.

The main contributions in this thesis are:

   i) 	We determine the price of defaultable bonds in a
 	regime-switching market for structural models with European
 	type payoff. We use the method of quadratic hedging and
 	minimal martingale measure to determine the defaultable bond
 	prices. We also obtain hedging strategies and the
 	corresponding residual risk for these models. The defaultable
 	bond prices are obtained as solution to a system of PDEs
 	(partial differential equations) with appropriate terminal
 	and boundary conditions. We show the existence and
 	uniqueness of the system of PDEs on an appropriate domain.

   ii)	We carry out a similar analysis for the reduced-form models
 	in a regime-switching market. We extend some of the existing
 	models in the literature for correlated default timings. We
 	price single-name and multi-name credit derivatives using
 	our regime switching models. The prices are obtained as
 	solution to a system of ODEs (ordinary differential
 	equations) with appropriate terminal conditions.

   iii)	The price of the credit derivatives in our
 	regime-switching models are obtained as solutions
 	to a system of ODEs/PDEs subject to appropriate
 	terminal and boundary conditions. We solve these
 	ODEs/PDEs numerically and compare the relative behavior
 	of the credit derivative prices with and without regime
 	switching. We observe higher spread in our regime-switching
 	models. This resolves the low spread discrepancy that were
 	prevalent in the classical structural models. We show
 	further applications of our model by capturing important
 	phenomena that arise frequently in the financial market.
 	For instance, we illustrate the effects of business cycle,
 	tight liquidity situations and firm restructuring.
