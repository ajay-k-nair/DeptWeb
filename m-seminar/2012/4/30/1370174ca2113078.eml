Abstract:
In a foundational paper "Operators Possessing an Open Set of Eigenvalues"
written several decades ago, Cowen and Douglas showed that an operator T
on a Hilbert space H possessing an open set W (in complex plane) of
eigenvalues determines a holomorphic Hermitian vector bundle ET . One of
the basic theorems they prove states that the unitary equivalence class of
the operator T and the equivalence class of the holomorphic Hermitian
vector bundle ET are in one to one correspondence. This correspondence
appears somewhat mysterious until one detects the invariants for the
vector bundle ET in the operator T and vice-versa. Fortunately, this is
possible in some cases. Thus they point out that if the operator T
possesses the additional property that dimension of the eigenspace at each
point w in W is 1, then the map f on W, sending w to ker(T-w), admits a
non-zero holomorphic section, say S, and therefore defines a line bundle
LT on W.It is well known that the curvature KL of a line bundle LT is a
complete invariant for the line bundle LT . On the other hand, define

 	NT(w) = (T-w)|_{ker(T-w)^2} for each w in W,

and note that NT(w)^2 = 0. It follows that, for two operators T_1 and T_2,
if T_1 is unitarily equivalent to T_2, then the corresponding operators
NT_1(w) and NT_2(w) are unitarily equivalent for all w in W. However,
Cowen and Douglas prove the non-trivial converse, namely that if
NT_1(w) and N_T2(w) are unitarily equivalent for all w in W then T_1
and T_2 are unitarily equivalent. What does this have to do with the line
bundles LT_1 and LT_2? To answer this question, we must ask what is a
complete invariant for the unitary equivalence class of the operator NT(w).
To find such a complete invariant we represent NT(w) with respect to the
orthonormal basis obtained from the two linearly independent vectors S(w),
S'(w) by Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization process. Then an easy computation
shows that KL(w) is a complete invariant for NT (w), for w in W. This
explains the relationship between the line bundle LT and the operator T
in an explicit manner.

Subsequently, in the paper "Operators Possessing an Open Set of
Eigenvalues", Cowen and Douglas define a class of commuting operators
possessing an open set of eigenvalues and attempt to provide similar
computations as above. However, they give the details only for a pair of
commuting operators. While the results of that paper remain true in the
case of an arbitrary n-tuple of commuting operators, it requires
additional effort, which we explain in this thesis.
