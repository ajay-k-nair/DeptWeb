Dear All,
      Some of us will be having an informal, partly discussion based
seminar on `Mathematical Reasoning'.

First meeting: Wednesday, Nov 21, 2012 at 11:30 a.m. in LH-III

      To ensure that the seminar remains focused, the discussion will be
centered around the question `How do we make computers do mathematics (as
our collaborators)?' We will mainly be concerned with issues of reasoning,
not algorithms or code.
      All are welcome.
                                      regards,
                                      Siddhartha
