Absract:
In this thesis we study some questions related to vector bundles over hyper-
surfaces. More precisely, for hypersurfaces of dimension  2, we study the
extension problem of vector bundles. We find some cohomological conditions
under which a vector bundle over an ample divisor of non-singular projec-
tive variety, extends as a vector bundle to an open set containing that
ample divisor.

Our method is to follow the general Groethendieck-Lefschetz theory by
showing that a vector bundle extension exists over various thickenings of
the ample divisor.

For vector bundles of rank > 1, we find two separate cohomological
conditions on vector bundles which shows the extension to an open set
containing the ample divisor. For the case of line bundles, our method
unifies and
recovers the generalized Noether-Lefschetz theorems by Joshi and
Ravindra-Srinivas.
In the last part of the thesis, we make a specific study of vector bundles
over elliptic curve.


            ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED.

Faculty members and students of the Department are requested to attend.
