> Abstract:
> Grothendieck published an extraordinary paper entitled ”Resume de la
> theorie metrique des produits tensoriels topologiques” in 1953. The main
> result of this paper is the inequality which is commonly known as
> Grothendieck Inequality. Following Kirivine, in this article, we give the
> proof of Grothendieck Inequality. We reformulate it in different forms. We
> also investigate the famous Grothendieck constant KG. The Grothendieck
> constant was achieved by taking supremum over a special class of matrices.
> But our attempt will be to investigate it, considering a smaller class of
> matrices, namely only the positive definite matrices in this class.

>             ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED.
