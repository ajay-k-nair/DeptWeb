Dear all,

               Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                   SEMINAR


Speaker :   Dr. Thomas Richard

Title      :   Ricci flow of non-smooth spaces

Date     :   November 15, 2012 (Thursday)

Time     :   4:00 pm- 5:00 pm

Venue   :   Department of Mathematics, LH-III

Abstract :
Ricci flow is a PDE that deform the metric of a Riemannian manifold in the
direction of its Ricci curvature. For compact smooth manifolds, there is a
well established existence and uniqueness theory. However for some
applications it can be useful to consider Ricci flows of
non-smooth spaces, or metric spaces whose distance doesn't come from a
Riemannian metric. We will show that existence and uniqueness holds for
the Ricci flow of compact singular surfaces whose curvature is bounded
from below in the sense of Alexandrov.
