Speaker :   Mr. Dheeraj Kulkarni

Title:  Relative Symplectic Caps, 4-Genus and Fibered Knots.

Date:  July 13, 2012

Time: 11.00 am- 12.00 noon

Venue: Department of Mathematics, Lecture Hall 1

Abstract:

The $4$-genus of a knot is an important measure of complexity, related to
the unknotting number. A fundamental result used to study the $4$-genus
and related invariants of homology classes is the \emph{Thom Conjecture},
proved by Kronheimer-Mrowka, and its symplectic extension due to
Ozsvath-Szabo, which say that \textit{closed} symplectic surfaces
minimize genus.

Suppose $(X, \omega) $ is a symplectic 4-manifold with contact type
bounday $\partial X $ and $\Sigma $ is a symplectic surface in $X$ such
that $\partial \Sigma $ is a transverse knot in $\partial X $. In this
talk we show that there is a closed symplectic 4-manifold $Y $ with a
closed symplectic submanifold $ S$ such that the pair $(X, \Sigma) $
embeds symplectically into $(Y, S) $.  This gives a proof of the
relative version of Symplectic Thom Conjecture. We use this to
study 4-genus of fibered knots in $\mathbb{S}^3$.

We also discuss the symplectic convexity of unit circle bundle in a
Hermitian holomorphic line bundle over a Riemann surface.

This is joint work with Prof. Siddhartha Gadgil.


                   ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED.


Faculty members and students of the Department are requested to attend.
