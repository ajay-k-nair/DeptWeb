Title :    Extension theorems for vector bundles over hypersurfaces

Date :       July 10, 2012

Venue :     Department of Mathematics, Lecture Hall 3

Abstract: In this thesis we study some Questions on vector bundles over
hypersurfaces. More precisely, for hypersurfaces of dimension $\geq 2$, we
study the extension problem of Vector bundles. We try to find some
conditions under which a vector bundle over an ample divisor of
non-singular projective variety, extends as a vector bundle to an open set
containing that ample divisor.

Our method is to follow the general Groethendieck-Lefschetz theory by
trying to show that a vector bundle extension exists over the various
thickenings of the ample divisor. For the case of line bundles, our method
unifies and recovers the  Noether-Lefschetz theorems by Joshi and
Ravindra-Srinivas.

For rank $>$ 1, we find 2 separate cohomological conditions on bundle
which shows the extension over an open set.  For Line bundles, we give a
generalized version of Noether-Lefschetz theorem.

In the last part of the thesis, we make a specific study of vector bundles
over elliptic curves.


           ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED.

Faculty members and students of the Department are requested to attend.
