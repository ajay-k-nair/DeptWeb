Abstract: This talk will be on two themes that illustrate the rigidity and
regularity of holomorphic mappings. The first part will deal with results
concerning the smoothness of continuous CR (Cauchy -- Riemann) mappings;
in particular, that of Lipschitz continuous CR mappings from
h-extendible/semi-regular hypersurfaces into certain Levi co-rank one
hypersurfaces, in C^n. The second part will deal with the classification
of Kobayashi hyperbolic, finite type rigid polynomial domains in C^3.
