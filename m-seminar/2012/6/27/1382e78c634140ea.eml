Abstract:
von Neumann algebras are non commutative analogue of measure spaces. The
study of maximal abelian subalgebras (masas) in finite von Neumann
algebras is classical to the subject from its birth and is closely tied up
with Ergodic theory. Dixmier introduced two types of masas, namely,
regular (Cartan) and singular. The philosophies of these two kinds of
masas until recently were regarded as being different from each other.
After an introduction on the subject, we justify that the existing
theories can be unified. Using techniques from Free Probability and
playing with suitable amenable groups we exhibit: For each subset S of
$\mathbb{N}$ (could be empty), there exist uncountably many pairwise non
conjugate (by automorphism) singular masas in the free group factors for
each of which $S\cup {\infty\}$ arises as its Pukanzsky invariant
(multiplicity function). If time permits, some other issues related to
mixing, coarse bimodules, and Banach's problem on simple Lebesgue spectrum
will be addressed.
