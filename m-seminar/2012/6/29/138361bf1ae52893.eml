Abstract: Tempered stable distributions were introduced in
Rosinski 2007 as models that look like infinite variance stable
distributions in some central region, but they have lighter
(i.e. tempered) tails. We introduce a larger class of models that
allow for more variety in the tails. While some cases no longer
correspond to stable distributions they serve to make the class
more flexible, and in certain subclasses they have been shown
to provide a good fit to data. To characterize the possible tails
we give detailed results about finiteness of various moments.
We also give necessary and sufficient conditions for the tails
to be regularly varying. This last part allows us to characterize
the domain of attraction to which a particular tempered stable
distribution belongs. We will also characterize the weak limits
of sequences of tempered stable distributions. If time permits,
we will motivate why distributions that are stable-like in some
central region but with lighter tails may show up in applications.
