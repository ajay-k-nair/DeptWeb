Title   :  Risk-senstive control of continuous time Markov chains.

Abstract: We study risk-sensitive control of continuous time Markov
chains
taking values in discrete state space. We study both finite and infinite
horizon problems. In the finite horizon problem we characterise the
value
function via HJB equation and obtain an optimal Markov control. We do
the
same for infinite horizon discounted cost case. In the infinite horizon
average cost case we establish the existence of an optimal stationary
control under certain Lyapunov condition. We also develop a policy
iteration algorithm for finding an optimal control.

Title   : On some Statistical Properties of Multivariate q-Gaussian
Distribution and its application to Smoothed Functional Algorithms

Abstract: The importance of the q-Gaussian distribution lies in its
power-law
nature, and its close association with Gaussian, Cauchy and uniform
distributions. This distribution arises from maximization of a
generalized information measure. In this work, we study some key
properties related to higher order moments and q-moments of the
multivariate q-Gaussian distribution. Further, we present an algorithm
to generate multivariate q-Gaussian distribution.
We use these results of the q-Gaussian distribution to improve upon
the smoothing properties of Gaussian and Cauchy kernels. Based on
this, we propose a Smoothed Functional (SF) scheme for gradient and
Hessian estimation using q-Gaussian distribution. Our work extends the
class of distributions that can be used in SF algorithms by including
the q-Gaussian distributions for a range of q-values. We propose four
two-timescale algorithms for optimization of a stochastic objective
function using gradient descent and Newton based search methods. We
prove that each of the proposed algorithms converge to a local
optimum.
