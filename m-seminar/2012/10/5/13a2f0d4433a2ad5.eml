Dear All,

               Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                   SEMINAR


Speaker :   Dr. Micah Miller
                    IISc, Bangalore

Title      :   The String topology loop product through twisting cochains

Date     :   October 9, 2012 (Tuesday)

Time     :   3:30 p.m.- 4:30 p.m.

Venue   :   Department of Mathematics, LH-III


Abstract :  String topology is the study of the free loop space of a manifold
LM.  The loop product, defined on the homology of LM, is described
intuitively as a combination of the intersection product on M and
loop concatenation in the based loop space of M.  However, since the
intersection product is well-defined only on transversally intersecting
chains, this description is incomplete. Brown's theory of twisting
cochains provides a chain model of a bundle in terms of the chains on
the base and chains on the fiber.  We extend this theory so that it can
be applied to provide a model of the free loop space. We give a precise
definition of the loop product defined at the chain level.


            ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED,




                                            Chairman,
                                            Department of Mathematics
