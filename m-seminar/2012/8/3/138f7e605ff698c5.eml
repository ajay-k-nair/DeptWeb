Speaker :    Dr. Soumya Das

Title :       Fourier coefficients of Siegel modular forms

Date :       August 9th, 2012

Time :       4:00 pm- 5:00 pm

Venue:     Department of Mathematics, Lecture Hall 1



Abstract: We will discuss some questions concerning the
existence of families of Siegel modular forms with some prescribed non-zero
Fourier coefficients. If time permits, we also plan to discuss the question
of characterizing cusp forms by the growth of their Fourier coefficients.
Both are recent joint works with Siegfried Boecherer.
