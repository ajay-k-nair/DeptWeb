Abstract:
We consider functions $f$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ for which both $f$ and their
Fourier transforms $\hat{f}$ are bounded by the Gaussian
$e^{-\frac{a}{2}|x|^2}$ for some $0<a<1$. Using the Bargmann transform, we
show that their Fourier-Hermite coefficients have exponential decay. This
is an extension of the one dimensional result of M. K. Vemuri, in which
sharp estimates were proved. In higher dimensions, we obtain the analogous
result for functions $f$ which are $O(n)$-finite. Here by an $O(n)$-finite
function we mean a function whose restriction to the unit sphere $S^{n-1}$
has only finitely many terms in its spherical harmonic expansion. Some
partial results are proved for general functions. As a corollary to these
results, we obtain Hardy's uncertainty principle. An analogous problem is
studied in the case of Beurling's uncertainty principle.

Next we consider the structure of analytic and entire vectors for the
Schrodinger representations of the Heisenberg group. Using refined
versions of Hardy's theorem and their connection with Hermite expansions
we obtain very precise representation theorems for analytic and entire
vectors.
