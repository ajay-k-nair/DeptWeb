Title	: Structure of the entropy solution of a scalar conservation
 	  law with strict convex flux

Time	: 2:30 - 3:30 p.m.

Abstract:
We prove the Structure Theorem of the entropy solution. Furthermore we
obtain the shock regions each of which represents a single shock at
infinity. Using the structure Theorem we construct initial data
$u_0\in C_c^\f$ for which the solution exhibits infinitely many shocks
as $t \rightarrow \f$. Also we have generalized the asymptotic
behavior (the work of Dafermos, Liu, Kim) of the solution and obtain
the rate of decay of the solution with respect to the $N$-wave.

Basic ingredients in the proof of these results are Lax-Oleinik explicit
formula and generalized characteristics which was introduced by Dafermos.

This is joint work with Adimurthi and G.D. Veerappa Gowda

Title   : An asymptotic preserving all-Mach-number scheme for inviscid
 	  compressible flows

Time    : 4:00 - 5:00 p.m.

Abstract:
An asymptotic preserving, all-Mach-number, Godunov-type finite volume
scheme is presented for the numerical solution of the compressible Euler
equations of gas dynamics. It is well known (S. Kleinerman and A. Majda,
1982) that the purely hyperbolic compressible Euler equations converge
to the mixed hyperbolic-elliptic incompressible Euler equations when the
Mach number tends to zero. In this limit, the numerical schemes for the
Euler equations suffer from stiffness, loss of accuracy and stability
problems. Here, a single time-scale and multiple space-scales asymptotic
analysis (R. Klein, 1995) is used to split the Euler fluxes into stiff
acoustic and non-stiff convective parts. A semi-implicit discretisation
leads to a stable scheme which is asymptotic preserving; i.e. it provides
a consistent discretisation in both the compressible and the
incompressible regimes. In the new scheme the mass and momentum equations
are solved explicitly, whereas the  energy equation leads to an elliptic
equation for the pressure which complies with the divergence constraint
on the velocity. The time-step is solely determined by the non-stiff
convective fluxes and it is independent of the Mach number. The results
of some benchmark problems are presented, which validate the new scheme.
Part of this work is joint  with Sebastian Noelle, Maria Lukacova and
Claus-Dieter Munz.
