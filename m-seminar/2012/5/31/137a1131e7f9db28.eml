Abstract:
The Grushin operator is defined as $G:=-\triangle-|x|^2\partial_t^2$
on R^{n+1}. We study the boundedness of the multipliers $m(G)$ of $G$ on
$L^p(R^{n+1})$. We prove the analogue of the Hormander-Mihlin theorem for
$m(G)$. We  also study the boundedness of the solution of the wave
equation corresponding to $G$ on $L^p(R^{n+1})$. The main tool in studying
the above is the operator-valued Fourier multiplier
theorem by Lutz Weis.

Next we look at Toeplitz operators on some Segal-Bargmann spaces. Let
$T_g$ be the Toeplitz operator corresponding to g. We study the
boundedness of $T_g$ by transferring them to the underlying $L^2$ spaces. We 
make use of the above transference to get some sufficient
conditions on $g$ for the boundedness of $T_g$.



 		       ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED.
