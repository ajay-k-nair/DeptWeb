Abstract:
Potential theory is the name given to the broad field of analysis
encompassing such topics as harmonic and subharmonic functions,
the Dirichlet problem, Green's functions, potentials and capacity.
We wish to gain a deeper understanding of complex dynamics using the
tools and techniques of potential theory, and we will restrict
ourselves to the iteration of holomorphic polynomials.

We will be able to provide an explicit formula for computing the
capacity of a Julia set, which in some sense, gives us a finer
measurement of the set. In turn, this provides us with a sharp
estimate for the diameter of the Julia set. Further if we pick any
point $w$ from the Julia set, then the inverse images $q^{-n}(w)$
span the whole Julia set. In fact, the point-mass measures with
support at the discrete set consisting of the roots of the
polynomial $q^n - w$, will eventually converge to the equilibrium
measure of the Julia set, in the weak*-sense. This provides us with
a very effective insight into the analytic structure of the set.

Hausdorff dimension is one of the most effective notions of fractal
dimension in use. With the help of potential theory and some ergodic
theory, we can show that for a holomorphic family of polynomials
varying over a simply connected domain $D$, one can gain control over
how the Hausdorff dimensions of the respective Julia sets change with
the parameter.
