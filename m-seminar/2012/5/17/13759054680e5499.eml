Abstract:
Let $M$ be a closed smooth manifold. Consider the space of Riemannian
metrics $\mathcal{M}$ on $M$. A real valued function on $\mathcal{M}$
is called a Riemannian functional if it remains invariant under the action
of the group of diffeomorphisms of $M$ on $\mathcal{M}$. We will discuss
some geometric properties of the critical points of certain natural
Riemannian functionals in this lecture.
