 				   SEMINAR


Speaker	: Prof. S. Sundar
 	  Indian Stastical Institute, Delhi

Title	: Inverse semigroups and the Cuntz-Li algebras

Date	: May 15, 2012

Time	: 4:00 - 5:00 p.m.

Venue	: Department of Mathematics, Lecture Hall I

Abstract:
Let R be an integral domain such that every non-zero quotient R/mR is
finite. Consider the unitaries and isometries on \ell^{2}(R) induced
by the addition and the multiplication operation of the ring R. The
C*-algebra generated by these unitaries and isometries is called
the ring C*-algebra and was studied by Cuntz and Li.

In my talk, I will explain how inverse semigroups can be used to
understand these C*-algebras. Also some generalisation of the ring
C*-algebras will  be discussed.



 		    ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED.
