Title	: Dilations, functional model and a complete
 	  unitary invariant of a $\Gamma$-contraction

Abstract:
In this talk, we shall define $\Gamma$-contractions, which were
introduced by Jim Agler and Nicholas Young. We shall construct an
explicit $\Gamma$-isometric dilation of a $\Gamma$-contraction and
produce a genuine functional model. A crucial operator equation has
to be solved for constructing such a dilation. We shall show how the
existence of such a solution characterizes a $\Gamma$-contraction.
This solution, which is unique, also provides a complete unitary
invariant.
