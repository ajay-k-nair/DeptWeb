Abstract:
Certain classes of non-local pseudo-differential operators can be
associated with Markov processes and this result has an infinite
dimensional counterpart too. The best known example is the Levy process
with its generator an integro-differential operator. In this talk we
will give an introduction to stochastic Navier-Stokes equation with
jump (Levy) noise and point out opportunities for harmonic as well as
stochastic analysis to gain understanding in solvability theory and
applications such as control and filtering theory.
