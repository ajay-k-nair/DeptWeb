   Title: Noncommutative analogues of the Fej\'er-Riesz Theorem

   Venue: LH 1, Department of Mathematics, IISc

   Date and Time:  25th April 2011 (Monday), 4-5 PM


   Abstract: The classical Fej\'er-Riesz Theorem states that a nonnegative
trigonometric polynomial can be factored as the absolute square of an
analytic polynomial.  Indeed, the factorization can be done with an
outer polynomial.  Various generalizations of this result have been
considered.  For example, Rosenblum showed that the result remained true
for operator valued trigonometric polynomials.  If one instead considers
operator valued polynomials in several variables, one obtains
factorization results for strictly positive polynomials, though
outer factorizations become much more problematic.  In another
direction, Scott McCullough proved a factorization result for so-called
hereditary trigonometric polynomials in freely noncommuting variables
(strict positivity not needed).  In this talk we consider an analogue of
(hereditary) trigonometric polynomials over discrete groups, and give a
result which includes a strict form of McCullough's theorem as well as
the multivariable version of Rosenblum's theorem.
