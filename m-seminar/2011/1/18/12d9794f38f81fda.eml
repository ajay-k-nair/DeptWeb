Abstract:
I will describe some joint work with Todorcevic on the Tukey theory
of ultrafilters on the natural numbers. The notion of Tukey
equivalence tries to capture the idea that two directed posets
"look cofinally the same", or have the same "cofinal type". As such,
it provides a device for a rough classification of directed sets based
upon their "cofinal type", as opposed to an exact classification based
on their isomorphism type. This notion has recently received a lot of
attention in various contexts in set theory. As background, I will
illustrate the idea of rough classification with several examples,
and  explain how rough classification based on Tukey equivalence fits
in with other work in set theory. The talk will be based on the paper
"Cofinal types of ultrafilters". A preprint of the paper is available
on my website: http://www.math.toronto.edu/raghavan .
