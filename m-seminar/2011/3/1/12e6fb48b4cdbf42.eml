Abstract:
Let A be a selfadjoint operator. We are interested in the discrete
spectrum of B = A+M where B is non-selfadjoint. If the resolvent
difference is in the Schatten class S_p, then we have an estimate
on the distribution of the eigenvalues of B. By means of this
estimate we can give qualitative estimates for the number of
eigenvalues of B or their moments. That can be applied to Schodinger
operators with complex potentials.
