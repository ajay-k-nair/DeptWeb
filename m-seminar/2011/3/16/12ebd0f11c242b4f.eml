Abstract:
Beginning with the attempts of Heisenberg and Pauli in the 1920's,
the subject grew at an astonishing speed, culminating in the
remarkable predictive success of Quantum Electrodynamics. Different
attempts to bring the subject to a sound mathematical footing 
(comparable to that of Quantum Mechanics) -- whether analytic, 
operator-algebraic or geometric --  have tasted only partial success.
These talks will try to  give a bird's-eye view of the  mathematical
areas (ideas) spawned by these attempts,  keeping in view the recent
book of Folland on this subject.
