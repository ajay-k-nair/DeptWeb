  				SEMINAR


Speaker	: Prof. Siddhartha Gadgil

Title	: The Goldman Bracket and Intersection Numbers

Date	: August 8, 2011

Time	: 2:00-3:00 p.m.

Venue	: Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
The Goldman bracket associates a Lie Algebra to closed curves
on a surface. I shall describe the bracket and its basic properties. I
shall also sketch some joint work with Moira Chas, where we show that
the Goldman bracket together with the operation of taking powers
determines geometric intersection and self-intersection numbers.
