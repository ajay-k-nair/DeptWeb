Speaker : Prof. Keith Burns
    Northwestern University

Title  : Ergodicity of the geodesic flow of the Weil-Petersson metric

Date  : August 19, 2011

Time  : 4:00-5:00 p.m.

Venue  : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:  The Weil-Petersson metric is a Riemannian metric on the
moduli space of a
surface. It has negative curvature, but is incomplete. Analogy with the
results of Hopf and Anosov for complete metrics of negative curvature
suggested that the geodesic flow for the Weil-Petersson metric should be
ergodic, but the incompleteness of the metric and insufficient knowledge
of its geometry delayed a proof. We now know a great deal about the
geometry of the Weil-Petersson metric, in large part due to the work of
Scott Wolpert, and ergodicity of the geodesic flow has been proved by
Burns, Masur and Wilkinson. The proof uses the results of Wolpert and the
theory of nonuniformly hyperbolic  dynamical systems, in the particular
the work of Katok and Strelcyn.
