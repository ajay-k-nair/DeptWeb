Abstract:
The empirical spectral distribution (ESD) of the sample variance
covariance matrix of i.i.d. observations under suitable moment
conditions converges almost surely as the dimension tends to
infinity. The limiting spectral distribution (LSD)  is universal and
is known in closed form with support  [0,4].

We show that the ESD of the sample autocovariance matrix converges as
the dimension increases, when the time series is a linear process
with reasonable restriction on the coefficients. This limit does not
depend on the distribution of the underlying driving i.i.d. sequence
but in contrast to the sample variance covariance matrix, its support
is unbounded. The limit moments are certain functions of the
autocovariances. This limit is inconsistent in the sense that it does
not coincide with the spectral distribution of the theoretical
autocovariance matrix. However, if we consider a suitably tapered
version of the autocovariance matrix, then its LSD also exists and is
consistent. We also discuss the existence of the LSD for banded
sample autocovariance matrices. For banded matrices, the limit has
unbounded support as long as the number of nonzero diagonals in
proportion to the dimension of the matrix is bounded away from zero.
If this ratio tends to zero, then the limit has bounded support and
is consistent. Finally we also study the LSD of a naturally modified
version of the autocovariance matrix which is not nonnegative
definite.
