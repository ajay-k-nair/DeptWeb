Abstract:
In this talk, we discuss two problems: the sampling problem for a given
class of functions on $\mathbb{R}$ (direct problem) and the reconstruction
of a function from finite samples (inverse problem). In the sampling
problem, we are given a class of functions $V\subset L^2(\mathbb{R})$
and one seeks to find sets of discrete samples such that any $f$ in
$V$ can be completely recovered from its values at the sample points.
Here we address the sampling problem for the class of functions
$V = V(\varphi)$, the (integer) shift invariant space defined by a
generator $\varphi$ with some general assumption. In the second problem,
we discuss the problem of reconstruction of a real-valued function $f$
on $X\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ from the given data
$\{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i=1}^n\subset X\times\mathbb{R}$, where it is assumed
that $y_i=f(x_i)+\xi_i$ and $(\xi_1,...,\xi_n)$ is a noise vector. In
particular, we are interested in reconstructing the function at points
outside the closed convex hull of $\{x_1,...,x_n\}$, which is the
so-called extrapolation problem. We consider this problem in the
framework of statistical learning theory and regularization networks.
In this framework, we address the major issues: how to choose an
appropriate hypothesis space and regularized predictor for given data
through a meta-learning approach. We employ the proposed method for blood
glucose prediction in diabetes patients. Further, using real clinical
data, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-art
(time series and neural-network-based models).
