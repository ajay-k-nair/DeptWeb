Abstract:
Let $F$ be a closed orientable surface of genus $g \geq 2$ and $C$ be
a simple closed curve in $F$. Let $t_C$ denote a left-handed Dehn twist
about $C$. When $C$ is a nonseparating curve, D. Margalit and
S. Schleimer showed the existence of such roots by finding elegant
examples of roots of $t_C$ whose degree is $2g + 1$ on a surface of
genus $g + 1$. This motivated an earlier collaborative work with D.
McCullough in which we derived conditions for the existence of a root
of degree $n$. We also showed that Margalit-Schleimer roots achieve the
maximum value of $n$ among all the roots for a given genus. Suppose that
$C$ is a separating curve in $F$. First, we derive algebraic conditions
for the existence of roots in Mod$(F)$ of the Dehn twist $t_C$ about $C$.
Finally, we show that if $n$ is the degree of a root, then
$n \leq 4g^2 +  2g$, and for $g \geq 10$, $n \leq \frac{16}{5}g^2+ 12g +
\frac{45}{4}$.
