Title	: The $Cos^\lambda$ transform as intertwining operator between
 	   generalized principal series representations of SL(n+1,K)

Abstract:
The $Cos^\lambda$ transform on real Grassmann manifolds was first
studied in convex geometry. The definition of this integral transform
has been later extended to Grassmann manifolds over $\mathbb K$,
where $\mathbb K$ denotes the reals, the complex numbers or the
quaternions.

In this talk we show that the $Cos^\lambda$ transform can be obtained
by means of standard intertwining operators between certain
generalized principal series representations of $SL(n+1,\mathbb K)$.
Representation theoretical methods can therefore be employed in its
study. Some of the results are outlined.

This is joint work with Gestur Olafsson.
