Abstract:
We introduce the concept of optimal test functions that guarantee
stability of resulting numerical schemes. Petrov-Galerkin methods seek
approximate solutions of boundary value problems in a "trial" space by
weakly imposing all equations via a (possibly different) "test" space.
A basic design principle is that while trial spaces must have good
approximation properties, the test space must be chosen for stability. The
optimal test functions are those that realize discrete stability constants
equal to those in the wellposedness estimates for the undiscretized
boundary value problem.  When such functions are used within an
ultra-weak variational formulation, we obtain Discontinuous
Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) methods that exhibit remarkable stability
properties. We present the first complete theory for the DPG for Laplace's
equation as well as numerical results for other more complex applications.
