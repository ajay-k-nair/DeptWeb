Abstract:
      Let R be the reflection group of the complex leech lattice plus a
hyperbolic cell. Let D be the incidence graph of the projective plane
over the finite field with 3 elements. Let A(D) be the Artin group of
D: generators of A(D) correspond to vertices of D. Two generators
braid if there is an edge between them, otherwise they commute.

It is surprising that both the bimonster and the reflection group R
are quotients of A(D) when the generators are mapped to elements of
order 2 and 3 respectively. A conjecture by Daniel Allcock seeks to
explain this connection between R and the bimonster. We shall try
to explain some of the evidences for the conjecture so far.

We shall see that D behaves like the Coxeter-Dynkin diagram for the
reflection group R. This imprecise analogy with Weyl groups actually
makes our proofs work. There is a parallel story for a quaternionic
hyperbolic reflection group where the analogies repeat.
