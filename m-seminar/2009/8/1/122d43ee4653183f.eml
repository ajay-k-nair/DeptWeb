Abstract:
      Consider a multidimensional diffusion model where the drift and the
diffusion coefficients for individual coordinates are functions of
the relative sizes of their current value compared to the others.
Two such models were introduced by Fernholz and Karatzas as models
for equity markets to reflect some well-known empirically observed
facts. In the first model, called 'Rank-based', the time-dynamics is
determined by the ordering in which the coordinate values can be
arranged at
any point of time. In the other, named the 'Volatility-stabilized', the
parameters are functions of the ratio of the current value to the total
sum over all coordinates. We show some remarkable properties of these
models, in  particular, phase transitions and infinite divisibility.
Relationships with existing models of queueing, dynamic spin glasses, and
statistical genetics will be discussed. Part of the material is based on
separate joint work with Sourav Chatterjee and Jim Pitman.
