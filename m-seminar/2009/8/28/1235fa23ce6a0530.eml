Abstract:
       Heuristics indicate that more the clustering in a point process, 
worse the percolation will be. We shall in this talk see a first
step towards a formal proof of this heuristic. Here is a more
precise abstract of the results we shall see in the talk.

Given a point process P = { Xi } in the euclidean plane, the random
geometric graph G(r) is the graph with vertex set P and edge set E(r) := {
(Xi,Xj) : | Xi - Xj | <= r }.  By percolation of G, we mean the existence
of an infinite component in G. The critical percolation radius is defined
as r(P) := inf { r : Pr ( G percolates ) > 0 }. We shall define some lower
( r0(P), r1(P) ) and upper ( r'(P) ) critical radii which are lower and
upper bounds for r(P) respectively. The main result will be that when P1
<= P2 in directionally convex order, then r0(P1) <= r0(P2) and similarly
for the other two critical radii.  I shall give a brief introduction to
directionally convex ordering of point processes and also show why
directionally convex order can be considered as a measure of clustering of
a point process. The proofs use various discrete approximations of
continuum percolation model and the results from our earlier work on
directionally convex ordering of point processes. I shall conclude with
examples of point processes which are directionally convex ordered (i.e,
point processes that satisfy the assumption of our result ) some
generalizations for level sets of random fields.
