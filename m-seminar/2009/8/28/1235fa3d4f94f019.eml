Abstract:
       Consider a system of N interacting particles evolving over time
with Markovian dynamics. The interaction occurs only due to a
shared resource. I shall briefly sketch the classical
tightness-existence-uniqueness approach used to prove weak
convergence of the system to a limiting system as N tends to
infinity. I shall illustrate another approach in more detail with
the example of a nonlinear Markov chain. In the case of
exchangeable particles, weak convergence of the system implies
propogation of chaos i.e, in the limiting system particles evolve
independently due to a deterministically shared resource.
