Abstract:
       Given a surface, one can consider the set of free homotopy classes of
oriented closed curves  (this is the set of equivalence classes of
maps from the circle into the surface, where two such maps are
equivalent if the corresponding curves can be deformed one into the
other.)
Given a free homotopy class  one can ask what is the minimum number of
times (counted with multiplicity) in which a curve in that class
intersects itself. This is the minimal self-intersection number of
the free homotopy class.
Analogously, given two classes, one can ask what is the minimum number
of times representatives of  these classes intersect. This is the
minimal intersection number of these two classes.

In these talks, several problems (and some solutions) related to
minimal intersection and self-intersection will be discussed. Also,
some  algebraic structures closely related to the intersection and and
self-intersection will be introduced.

           All are Welcome.
                                              Chairman
