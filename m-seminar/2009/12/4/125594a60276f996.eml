Abstract:
       The appropriate context for algebraic-geometric realizations of
holomorphic representations of a complex semisimple group is that
of a compact homogeneous projective flag manifold Z = G/Q. One
topic of more current interest is the study of the possibility of
realizing (infinite-dimensional) unitary representations of a real
form G0 of G on function- and/or cohomology-spaces of open
G_0-orbits D in Z (flag domains) and their cycle spaces. After an
introduction for nonspecialists, we will indicate a proof by
Schubert incidence geometry of the Kobayashi hyperbolicity of the
relevant cycle spaces. This will then be applied to give an exact
description of the group Aut_O(D) of holomorphic automorphisms.

           All are Welcome.
                                              Chairman
