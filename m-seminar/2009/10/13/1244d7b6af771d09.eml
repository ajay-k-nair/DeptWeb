Abstract:
       For a noncompact complete and simply connected harmonic manifold M,
we prove the analyticity of Busemann functions on M. This is the
main result of this paper. An application of it shows that the
harmonic spaces having minimal horospheres have the bi-asymptotic
property. Finally we prove that the total Busemann function is
continuous in C^\infty topology. As a consequence of it we show
that the uniform divergence of geodesics holds in these spaces.

           All are Welcome.
                                              Chairman
