Dear Colleagues ,
        We are organising a conference on Geometric Topology and
Riemannian Geometry on August 12-15, 2010 at the Indian Institute of
Science in Bangalore, as a satellite to the International Congress of
Mathematicians 2010. The conference will consist of one hour talks by
leading mathematicians in the field, chosen by our scientific
organising committee.For more information on the conference, please
visit our web page at http://math.iisc.ernet.in/~gadgil/gtrg.html. This
conference is a programme of the newly established
International Centre for Theoretical Sciences of TIFR.
       There will be a registration fee of Rs. 2000 to cover food and
local transport and participants are expected to pay the cost of their
accommodation. However, we do have some on campus accomodation and funds
to cover local hospitality
(and waive the registration fee) as well as provide some support for
travel within India for a limited number of participants.
       As we need to make local arrangements, if you are interested
in attending the conference please pre-register by March 15, 2010. You
can do this either by filling out the pre-registration form at our
website or by filling in the information below and sending it to the
conference e-mail address gtrg2010@gmail.com (not this address).

                                                  With regards,
                                                 Basudeb Datta
                                                  Siddhartha Gadgil
