Title: Riemann-Roch, Alexander Duality and Free Resolutions.
>
>
> Abstract: The Riemann-Roch theorem is fundamental to algebraic geometry.
> In 2006, Baker and Norine discovered an analogue of the Riemann-Roch
> theorem for graphs. In fact, this theorem is not a mere analogue but has
> concrete relations with its algebro-geometric counterpart. Since its
> conception this topic has been explored in different directions, two
> significant directions are i. Connections to topics in discrete geometry
> and commutative algebra ii. As a tool to studying linear series on
> algebraic curves. We will provide a glimpse of these developments. Topics
> in commutative algebra such as Alexander duality and minimal free
> resolutions will make an appearance.  This talk is based on my
> dissertation and joint work with i. Bernd Sturmfels, ii. Frank-Olaf
> Schreyer and John Wilmes and iii. an ongoing work with Alex Fink.
