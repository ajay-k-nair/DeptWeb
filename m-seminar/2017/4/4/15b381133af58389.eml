Could you pass along to your mailing lists? Thanks!

Dear all,

The next lecture in the Simons Assorted Mathematics Open Seminar will be
this Friday 7 April, 4pm in the Simons Center ground floor.  Please join
us at 3:45 for tea and snacks (either outside the Simons door or on the
lawn just outside the building).

This week, the speaker is Professor Siddhartha Gadgil of the IISc
Mathematics Department.  Siddhartha began his career as a low-dimensional
topologist, but in recent years has turned his attention to automated
theorem-proving.  
Title: "Automating Mathematics"

Abstract: I will discuss various stuff related to the goal of having computers play a central role in the discovery of mathematical proofs, including some of my own
efforts.

David F, Venky R and Amit V
