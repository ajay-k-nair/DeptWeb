Dear All,

There will be two lectures in the "Eigenfunctions" seminar series tomorrow
(Friday, 21st April).

--------------------------------------------
Lecture 1:

Title: Understanding statistics of a network via sampling

Speaker: Siva Athreya (ISI Bangalore)

Time and date: 2:15-3:15 PM, 21st April

Venue: LH-1, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:  We shall consider sampling procedures to construct subgraphs to
infer properties of a network. Specifically, we shall consider sampling
procedures in the context of dense and sparse graph  limits.  We will
explore open questions and interesting explorations at the undergraduate
level. The talk will be accessible to a general audience.
--------------------------------------------

Lecture 2:

Title: Very weakly negatively-curved domains having some potential theory

Speaker: Gautam Bharali (IISc)

Time and date: 3:30-4:30 PM, 21st April

Venue: LH-1, Department of Mathematics

Abstract: Given a metric space (X, d), there are several notions of it
being negatively curved. In this talk, we single out certain consequences
of negative curvature -- which are themselves weaker than (X, d) being
negatively curved -- that turn out to be very useful in proving results
about holomorphic maps. We shall illustrate what this means by giving a
proof of the Wolff-Denjoy theorem. (This theorem says that given a
holomorphic self-map f of the open unit disc, either f has a fixed point
in the open unit disc or there exists a point p on the unit circle such
that ALL orbits under the successive iterates of f approach p.) For most
of this talk, we shall focus on metric spaces or on geometry in one
complex variable. Towards the end, we shall briefly point out what can be
proved in domains in higher dimensions that have the aforementioned
negative-curvature-type properties. This part of the talk is joint work
with Andrew Zimmer.
