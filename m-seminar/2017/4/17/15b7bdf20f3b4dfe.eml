Subject: Von Neumann algebras


We are starting a reading group at ISI Bangalore on von Neumann Algebras with a view to learning group measure space construction.

The introductory lectures (for this reading group) will held on 20th April (Thursday) in the Second Floor Auditorium of ISI Bangalore. 

There will be two talks. The detailed schedule is given below:-

2:15 - 3:15 pm: A short introduction to von Neumann algebras 

Speaker: B. V. Rajarama Bhat, ISI Bangalore

Abstract: I will introduce three basic topologies on the algebra of all bounded operators on a Hilbert space and will give a proof of von Neumann's double commutant
theorem. I will also make noises as to why von Neumann algebra theory is considered as non-commutative measure theory.


3:15 - 3:30 pm: Coffee Break


3:30 - 4:30 pm: Quasi-invariant group actions, crossed product construction and stable random fields
Speaker: Parthanil Roy, ISI Bangalore

Abstract: The first part of this talk will explain the interplay between the ergodic theory of quasi-invariant group actions and stationary symmetric stable random
fields. Since such group actions are closely connected to von Neumann algebras through the crossed product construction, it is expected that so will be stable random
fields. The later part of the talk will focus on related conjectures and open problems. 


4:30 pm: Snacks
