Dear All,

There will be two lectures in the "Eigenfunctions" seminar series on 3rd
Feb, 2017.

The next in this series will be held on 17th Feb.


--------------------------------------------
Lecture 1:

Title: Playing with the nonlinearity of the Navier-Stokes Equation

Speaker: Samriddhi  Sankar  Ray (ICTS)

Time and date: 2:15-3:15 PM,  3rd Feb. 2017, Friday

Venue: LH-1, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:  Understanding the origins of intermittency in turbulence
remains one of the most
fundamental challenges in applied mathematics. In recent years there has
been a fresh
attempt to understand this problem through the development of the method
of Fourier
decimation. In this talk, we will review these recent results and analyse
the role of precise
numerical simulations in understanding the mathematics of the
Navier-Stokes and Euler
equations.

--------------------------------------------
Lecture 2:

Title: What is finiteness?

Speaker: Abhishek  Banerjee (IISc)

Time and date: 3:30-4:30 PM, 3rd Feb

Venue: LH-1, Department of Mathematics

Abstract: It is generally well known that there is an innate notion of
things like isomorphisms
or epimorphisms. This allows us to talk about isomorphisms or epimorphisms
of various
objects: groups, rings, algebras,etc. In other words, "isomorphism" is
really a categorical
notion.However, it is not so well known that finiteness itself is
alsocategorical. In this talk, we
will discuss how finiteness applies tovarious categories. This will allow
usto see finite sets,
finite dimensional vector spaces, finitely generated algebras and compact
sets as
manifestations of the same basic idea.
