Dear all,

Vamsi and I plan to run an (approximately weekly) seminar on topics
related to
surface-group representations.

These topics shall include: the Uniformization theorem, Teichmüller spaces,
Donaldson’s proof of the Narasimhan-Seshadri Theorem, and convex projective
structures on surfaces (following work of Goldman, Labourie and Loftin).
The focus will be on the analytic tools used in these subjects, and their
relation
to geometry.

We currently plan to meet on Wednesday afternoons (say 3pm). However our
first
meeting is on *Monday, February 6th* at 2:30pm in LH5.

Anyone interested can attend talks, or volunteer to give one.

Best,
Subhojoy
