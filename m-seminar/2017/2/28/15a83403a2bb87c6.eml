Abstract:
The PASEP  (partially asymmetric exclusion model) is a model of particles 
hopping on a one-dimensional strip of N sites with open boundaries. It has 
been intensively studied by physicists and appears as a
toy model in the physics of dynamical systems. The distribution of 
stationary probabilities has been computed using the so-called matrix 
ansatz (Derrida, Evans, Hakim, Pasquier). The solution involves a
certain quadratic algebra and a representation of this algebra with 
infinite tridiagonal matrices related to the Askey-Wilson polynomials. 
These  polynomials are a famous family of orthogonal polynomials
which sit at the top of the hierarchy of classical orthogonal polynomials.

In recent years intensive works has been done by combinatorists in order 
to give combinatorial interpretations of these stationary probabilities in 
terms of some weighted tableaux:  permutations tableaux
(Postnikkov, Steingrimsson, Williams, Corteel), alternative tableaux 
(X.V.), tree-like tableaux (Aval, Boussicault, Nadeau), straircase 
tableaux (Corteel, Williams). The combinatorics of permutations,
Catalan numbers and orthogonal polynomials plays a crucial role.

The PASEP model has been extended in physics with two types of particles. 
In this talk we introduce rhombic alternative tableaux which give 
combinatorial interpretation of the stationary probabilities. These
tableaux defined from a tiling of some portions of the triangular lattice, 
are enumerated by the Lah numbers which are counting certain assemblées of 
permutations. Their weighted generating function give a
combinatorial interpretation of the 2-species PASEP (with 3 parameters). 
We describe a bijection between  rhombic alternative tableaux and 
assemblées of permutations  and get a bijective proof of the formula
giving the partition function of the model. The general 2-species model 
with 5 parameters is related to Koorwinder-Macdonald polynomials (Corteel, 
Mandelshtam, Williams).
