Dear all,

Our next meeting in the informal seminar on surface-group
representations  will be on *Wednesday 15th Feb* at 3pm at LH-5.

I shall talk about geometric structures on surfaces, and introduce the
Teichmuller/Fricke space and its parametrization using harmonic maps.
There should also be some coffee.

As Vamsi mentioned, there is a seminar website at:
http://math.iisc.ac.in/~vamsipingali/grouprepseminar.html

Best,
Subhojoy
