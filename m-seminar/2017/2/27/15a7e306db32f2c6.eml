Dear All,


                        Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                            Lecture Series

The next two lectures on "Topology Optimization-An Introduction" by
Dr. Ravi Prakash will be on 06/03/2017 and 08/03/2017 at 2.30PM at LH1.

Title: Topology Optimization-An Introduction

Speaker: Dr. Ravi Prakash,
         Assistant Professor,
         Universidad de Concepcion,
         Concepcion, Chile.

Time and date: 2.30-3.30 PM, 6th(Monday) and 8th(Wednesday) March 2017

Venue: LH-1, Department of Mathematics

Abstract: In the series of three lectures, the concept of topological
derivatives and it's use in topology optimization and inverse problems
will be explained. In the first two lectures, the notions and the
mathematical background of topological derivatives will be introduced
through simple examples. In the last lecture, the inverse potential
problem governed by Schrodinger equation will be solved using the concepts
described in the first two lectures. Few numerical results will also be
demonstrated.

              ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED
-Chairman
