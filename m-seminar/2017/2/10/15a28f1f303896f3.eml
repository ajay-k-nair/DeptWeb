Title: Topology Optimization-An Introduction

Speaker: Dr. Ravi Prakash,
         Assistant Professor,
         Universidad de Concepcion,
         Concepcion, Chile

Time and date: 2.30-3.30 PM, Monday 13th Feb 2017

Venue: LH-1, Department of Mathematics

Abstract: In the series of three lectures, the concept of topological
derivatives and it's use in topology optimization and inverse problems
will be explained. In the first two lectures, the notions and the
mathematical background of topological derivatives will be introduced
through simple examples. In the last lecture, the inverse potential
problem governed by Schrodinger equation will be solved using the concepts
described in the first two lectures. Few numerical results will also be
demonstrated.

              ALL ARE CORDIALLY INVITED
-Chairman
