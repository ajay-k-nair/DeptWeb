Dear all,

We shall continue with our informal seminar on surface-group
representations tomorrow (22nd Feb) at 2:30pm at LH-5.

Please note that the change of time to 2:30pm instead of 3pm.
This is due to another IISc event tomorrow that some of us might attend.

Also, you could check out some new links to relevant articles, at the
seminar webpage:

Best,
Subhojoy
