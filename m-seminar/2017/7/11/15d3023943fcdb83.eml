ABSTRACT:
The Pick--Nevanlinna interpolation problem in its fullest generality is as
follows:

Given domains D_1, D_2 in complex Euclidean spaces, and a set \{(z_i,w_i):
1\leq i\leq N\}\subset D_1\times D_2, where z_i are distinct and N is a
positive integer \geq 2, find necessary and sufficient conditions for the
existence of a holomorphic map F from D_1 into D_2 such that F(z_i) = w_i,
1\leq N.

When such a map F exists, we say that F is an interpolant of the data. Of
course, this problem is intractable at the above level of generality.
However, two special cases of the problem -- which we shall study in this
thesis -- have been of lasting interest:

INTERPOLATION FROM THE POLYDISC TO THE UNIT DISC: This is the case D_1 =
D^n and D_2 = D, where D denotes the open unit disc in the complex plane
and n is a positive integer. The problem itself originates with Georg
Pick's well-known theorem (independently discovered by Nevanlinna) for the
case n=1. Much later, Sarason gave another proof of Pick's result using an
operator-theoretic approach, which is very influential. Using this
approach for n\geq 2, Agler--McCarthy provided a solution to the problem
with the restriction that the interpolant is in the Schur--Agler class.
This is notable because when n = 2 the latter result completely solves the
problem for the case D_1 = D^2, D_2 = D. However, Pick's approach can also
be effective for n\geq 2. In this thesis, we give an alternative
characterization for the existence of a 3-point interpolant based on
Pick's approach and involving the study of rational inner functions.

Cole, Lewis and Wermer lifted Sarason's approach to uniform algebras --
leading to a characterization for the existence of an interpolant in terms
of the positivity of a large, rather abstractly-defined family of (N\times
N) matrices. McCullough later refined their result by identifying a
smaller family of matrices. The second result of this thesis is in the
same vein, namely: it provides a characterization of those data that admit
a D^n-to-D interpolant in terms of the positivity of a family of matrices
parametrized by a class of polynomials.


INTERPOLATION FORM THE UNIT DISC TO THE SPECTRAL UNIT BALL: This is the
case D_1 = D and D_2 is the set of all (n\times n) matrices with spectral
radius less than 1. The interest in this arises from problems in Control
Theory. Bercovici, Fois and Tannenbaum adapted Sarason's methods to give a
(somewhat hard-to-check) characterization for the existence of an
interpolant under a very mild restriction. Later, Agler--Young established
a relation between the interpolation problem in the spectral unit ball and
that in the symmetrized polydisc -- leading to a necessary condition for
the existence of an interpolant. Bharali later provided a new inequivalent
necessary condition for the existence of an interpolant for any n and N=2.
We shall present a necessary condition for the existence of a 3-point
interpolant. This we shall achieve by modifying Pick's approach and
applying the aforementioned result due to Bharali.


ALL ARE WELCOME.
