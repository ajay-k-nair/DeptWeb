Dear Colleagues,

Indian Women and Mathematics (IWM) holds an annual conference each year.
IISc is the venue of the conference this year.

The conference is this week. It will be held on July 13, 14 & 15, 2017.

The website for the 2017 Annual Conference of IWM is now up. The link to
it is:

https://sites.google.com/site/iwmconference2017iisc/ .

The list of speakers, the conference schedule, and the abstracts of all
the talks and posters are posted under the "Programme" tab on the above
website.

You are invited to take part in this conference (a.k.a. IWM 2017).
However, since our funding for this event is very bare-bones, please note
that UNLESS you are a registered participant or were separately invited by
the conference organisers (as a speaker, panelist, etc.), we CANNOT:
a) Provide you lunch/dinner at the conference;
b) Cover the cost of your local transportation.

However, since we are addressing an audience of mathematicians: you are
welcome to the coffee (or tea, if you prefer)!

The venue of IWM 2017 is the Old Physics Building. Please click on the
"Practical Information" tab for more details.

A few words about IWM: it is a collective of Indian mathematicians -- in
existence since 2009 -- whose objective has been to encourage more women
to pursue higher education in mathematics. This website:

https://sites.google.com/site/iwmmath/

will give you more information of what IWM does.

Looking forward to seeing you at IWM 2017, and

With best regards,

Pooja Singla,
Gautam Bharali,
Gadadhar Misra,
E.K. Narayanan
(Organising Committee for
IWM 2017)
