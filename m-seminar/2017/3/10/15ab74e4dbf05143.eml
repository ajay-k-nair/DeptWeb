Title   : At the crossroad of algebra, combinatorics and physics: the 
2-species PASEP

Abstract:
The PASEP  (partially asymmetric exclusion model) is a model of particles 
hopping on a one-dimensional strip of N sites with open boundaries. It has 
been intensively studied by physicists and appears as a
toy model in the physics of dynamical systems. The distribution of stationary 
probabilities has been computed using the so-called matrix ansatz (Derrida, 
Evans, Hakim, Pasquier). The solution involves a
certain quadratic algebra and a representation of this algebra with infinite 
tridiagonal matrices related to the Askey-Wilson polynomials. These 
polynomials are a famous family of orthogonal polynomials
which sit at the top of the hierarchy of classical orthogonal polynomials.

In recent years intensive works has been done by combinatorists in order to 
give combinatorial interpretations of these stationary probabilities in terms 
of some weighted tableaux:  permutations tableaux
(Postnikkov, Steingrimsson, Williams, Corteel), alternative tableaux (X.V.), 
tree-like tableaux (Aval, Boussicault, Nadeau), straircase tableaux (Corteel, 
Williams). The combinatorics of permutations,
Catalan numbers and orthogonal polynomials plays a crucial role.

The PASEP model has been extended in physics with two types of particles. In 
this talk we introduce rhombic alternative tableaux which give combinatorial 
interpretation of the stationary probabilities. These
tableaux defined from a tiling of some portions of the triangular lattice, are 
enumerated by the Lah numbers which are counting certain assemblées of 
permutations. Their weighted generating function give a
combinatorial interpretation of the 2-species PASEP (with 3 parameters). We 
describe a bijection between  rhombic alternative tableaux and assemblées of 
permutations  and get a bijective proof of the formula
giving the partition function of the model. The general 2-species model with 5 
parameters is related to Koorwinder-Macdonald polynomials (Corteel, 
Mandelshtam, Williams).
