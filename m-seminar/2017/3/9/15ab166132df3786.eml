Dear all,

                            Department of Mathematics
                     Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                     SEMINAR



Speaker : Xavier Viennot
 	  CNRS Emeritus Research Director, LaBRI, Bordeaux University
 	  Adjunct Professor at IMSc, Chennai

Title   : Proofs without words: the example of the Ramanujan continued fraction

Date    : 9th March, 2017 (Thursday)

Time    : 2:00 p.m. - 3:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
Visual proofs of identities were common at the Greek time, such as the 
Pythagoras theorem. In the same spirit, with the renaissance of combinatorics, 
visual proofs of much deeper identities become possible. Some identities can be 
interpreted at the combinatorial level, and the identity is a consequence of 
the construction a weight preserving bijection between the objects interpreting 
both sides of the identity.

In this lecture, I will give an example involving the famous and classical 
Ramanujan continued fraction. The construction is based on the concept of 
"heaps of pieces", which gives a spatial interpretation of the commutation 
monoids introduced by Cartier and Foata in 1969.

For more information on the theory of heaps of pieces, go to website of the 
combinatorial course I am giving at IMSc: www.xavierviennot/coursIMSc2017


NOTE: The speaker has promised to make this talk accessible to students.


All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
