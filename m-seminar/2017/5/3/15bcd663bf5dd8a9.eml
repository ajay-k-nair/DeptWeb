Subject: SAMOSe Lecture 5/5/17: Amit Vutha, "Symmetries and dynamics"

Time and Place: 4pm Friday May 5, Simons Center ground floor, NCBS

Speaker: Amit Vutha

Title: Symmetries and dynamics

Abstract: Simply put, a symmetry of a dynamical system is any transformation that takes solutions to solutions. Although symmetries constrain dynamics, the symmetries of
a dynamical system can be used in a systematic way to analyze, predict, and understand general properties of these systems. After reviewing definitions and major
results, I will explore applications of symmetry methods in various contexts. Some familiarity with the notion of a group will be useful, but not necessary.
