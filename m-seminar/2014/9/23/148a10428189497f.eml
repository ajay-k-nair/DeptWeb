Dear all,

                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR

Title   : Riesz potentials and Sobolev embedding theorems

Date    : 23rd September, 2014 (Tuesday)

Time    : 4:00 - 5:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
I shall begin with the mapping properties of classical Riesz
potentials acting on $L^p$-spaces. After reviewing the literature, I shall
present our new ''almost'' Lipschitz continuity estimates for these and
related potentials (including, for instance, the logarithmic potential) in
the so-called supercritical exponent. Finally, I shall show how one could
apply these estimates to deduce Sobolev embedding theorems.
This is joint work with Daniel Spector and is available on arXiv:1404.1563.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
