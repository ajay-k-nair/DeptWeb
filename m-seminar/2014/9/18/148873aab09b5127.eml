Dear all,

                           Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : Srikanth Tupurani

Title   : An interesting result about finite dimensional complex
semi-simple algebras

Date    : 22nd September, 2014 (Monday)

Time    : 4:00 - 5:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
I will prove the following interesting result about finite dimensional
complex semi-simple algebra. Let A be a finite-dimensional complex
semi-simple algebra without an M_{2}(C)  summand and let S be an
involutive unital C-algebra anti-automorphism of A. Then there exists an
element a in A such that a and S(a) generate A as an algebra. In the proof
I will use some basic results in linear algebra

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
