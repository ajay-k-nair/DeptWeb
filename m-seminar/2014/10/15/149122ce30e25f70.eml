ABSTRACT

Some of the early examples of series which we come across in Calculus
happen to be prototypical examples governing a subject within number
theory that goes by the appellation "special values of L-functions." In
this talk, I will introduce this subject via such classical examples, and
try to give some general idea of the theorems and conjectures that drive
the area. Ultimately, my aim will be to explain why certain integrals in
analytical
number theory, when interpreted as maps in cohomology, lead to deep
arithmetical theorems.
