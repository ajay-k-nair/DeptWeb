Abstract: This thesis investigates two different types of problems in
multi-variable operator theory. The first one deals with the defect
sequence for a contractive tuple and the second one deals with
wandering subspaces of the Bergman space and the Dirichlet space over
the polydisc. These are described in (I) and (II) below.

I.  We introduce the defect sequence for a contractive tuple of
Hilbert space operators and investigate its properties. We show that
there are upper bounds for the defect dimensions.  The upper bounds
are different in the non-commutative and in the commutative case. The
tuples for which these upper bounds are obtained are called maximal
contractive tuples. We show that the creation operator tuple  on the
full Fock space   and the co-ordinate multipliers  on the
Drury-Arveson space  are maximal.  We also show that if M is an
invariant subspace under the creation operator tuple on the full Fock
space, then the restriction  is always maximal. But the situation is
starkly different for co-invariant subspaces. A characterization for a
contractive tuple to be maximal is obtained. We define the notion of
maximality for a submodule of the Drury-Arveson module on the
d-dimensional unit ball.  For d=1, it is shown that every submodule of
the Hardy module over the unit disc is maximal. But for d>2, we prove
that any homogeneous submodule or a submodule generated by polynomials
is not maximal. We obtain a characterization of maximal submodules of
the Drury-Arveson module. We also study pure tuples and see how the
defect dimensions play a role in their irreducibility.

II. We  investigate the following question : Let (T_1, ....., T_n) be
a commuting n-tuple of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space H.
Does there exist a generating wandering subspace W for (T_1, .....,
T_n)? We got some affirmative answers for the doubly commuting
invariant subspaces of the Bergman space and the Dirichlet space over
the unit polydisc. We show that for any doubly commuting invariant
subspace  of the Bergman space or the Dirichlet space over polydisc,
the tuple consisting  of restrictions of co-ordinate  multiplication
operators always possesses a generating wandering subspace.

All are cordially invited!
