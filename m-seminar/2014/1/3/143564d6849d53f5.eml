Dear all,

                           Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : Prof Rizwanur Khan
          Texas A&M university at Qatar

Title   : L-4 norms of cusp forms in the level aspect

Date    : 3rd Jan, 2014 (Friday)

Time    : 3:00 - 4:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall III, Department of Mathematics

Abstract: Modular forms, particularly cusp forms, are ubiquitous objects
in mathematics. A natural way to understand a cusp form is to study its
L-p norms, for in principle the distribution of a function can be
recovered from the knowledge of its moments. In this talk I will describe
a new bound for the L-4 norm of a cusp form of prime level q, as q tends
to infinity. This work is joint with Jack Buttcane.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
