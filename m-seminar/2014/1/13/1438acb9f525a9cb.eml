Dear all,

We are planning to organize monthly mathematical meetings under the title of
_Eigen-Functions_. We will have two talks by people working in mathematical
fields. The idea is to improve interaction and communication in our
department among faculty, postdocs and students. These will be held on the
third Friday of every month during the semester periods.

The first session will be on Jan 17th. Our schedule for the first
Eigen-Function meeting is as follows.

2:00-3:00pm:    Nisheeth Vishnoi, Microsoft Research
3:00-3:30pm:    Tea break
3:30-4:30pm:    Krishna Athreya, IISc and Iowa State


The titles and abstracts follow.

Title   : Statistical estimation of integrals over infinite measure spaces

Date    : 17th Jan, 2014 (Friday)

Time    : 2:00 - 3:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract: Given a L1 function f over an infinite measure space S how
does one estimate the integral of f using statistical tools? In this
talk we propose using regenerative sequences with heavy tails to do
this. We obtain a consistent estimator and show the rate of
convergence is slower than 1/root n. When S is countable the SSRW
works.


All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
