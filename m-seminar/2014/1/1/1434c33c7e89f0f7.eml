Dear all,


Date & time:      Jan 2-10, 2014 all day

Venue:            LH-I, department of Mathematics.

Schedule: http://math.iisc.ernet.in/~nmi/GMCT_Programme.php

Abstract:

Considering mechanics from a variational point of view goes back to Euler,
Lagrange and Hamilton. The form of the variational principle most
important for continuous mechanics is due to Hamilton, and is often called
Hamilton&#65533;s principle or the least action principle. Modern
geometric mechanics stimulated from the work of Arnold, Marsden and their
coworkers. This application of geometrically based ideas to a concrete
physical problem is very much in the spirit of Poincare's work in
classical mechanics. Despite its maturity, geometric mechanics continuous
to grow and find application in various areas. In particular, it finds
application in the study of complex materials, nonholonomic mechanics,
discrete and stochastic mechanics. They play a significant role in the
theory of integrable systems and symmetry analysis of physics.

Topics covered during the programme:

Complex materials and dissipative systems
Nonholonomic dynamics
Control theory
Euler-Poincare formalism of integrable systems
Astrodynamics
Summary and Rationale


All are cordially invited.
