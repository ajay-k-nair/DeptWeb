                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : Prof Shanta Laishram

Title   : Powers in products of terms of Pell's and Pell-Lucas Sequences

Date    : 12th Feb, 2014 (Wednesday)

Time    : 3:00 - 4:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
t is known that there are only finitely many perfect powers in non
degenerate binary recurrence sequences. However explicitly finding them is
an interesting and a difficult problem for binary recurrence sequences. A
recent breakthrough result of Bugeaud, Mignotte and Siksek states that
Fibonacci sequences (F_n) given by F_0 = 0; F_1 = 1 and
F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n
for n >= 0 are perfect powers only for F_0 = 0; F_1 = 1; F_2 = 1; F_6 = 8
and F_12 = 144.

In this talk, we consider another well known Pell sequences
(u_n) given by u_0 = 0; u_1 = 1 and u_{n+2} = u_n + 2u_{n+1}
for n >= 0 and its associated Pell-Lucas sequences. We explicitly solve
the Diophantine equation u_n u_{n+d}...u_{n+(k-1)d} = y^m in positive
integers
n; d; k; y; m with m >= 2, y >= 2, gcd(n, d) = 1 and show that only
solutions are given by u_7 = 13^2; u_1 u_7 = 13^2:
A similar result is obtained for the associated Pell-Lucas recurrence
sequences too. In fact we obtain more general results. This is joint work
with Bravo, Das and Guzman.


All are cordially invited!
