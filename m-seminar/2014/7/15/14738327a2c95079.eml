                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : Sunder Sethuraman
          University of Arizona

Title   : An introduction to preferential attachment schemes

Date    : 15th July, 2014 (Tuesday)

Time    : (1) 10:00 - 11:00 am
          (2) 2:00 - 3:00 pm

Venue   : Lecture Hall III, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
Informally, a preferential attachment scheme is a dynamic (reinforcement)
process where a network is grown by attaching new vertices to old ones
selected with probability proportional to their weight, a function of
their degrees.  In these two talks, we give an introduction to these
schemes and discuss a couple of approaches to the study of the large scale
degree structure of these graphs.  One fruitful approach is to view the
scheme in terms of branching processes.  Another is to understand it in
terms of Markov decompositions and fluid limits.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
