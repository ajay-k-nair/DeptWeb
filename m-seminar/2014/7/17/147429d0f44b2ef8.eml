Dear all,

                           Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : P. P. Divakaran
          CMI

Title   : The Beginnings of Mathematics in India

Date    : 17th July, 2014 (Thursday)

Time    : 2:00 - 3:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
As in other ancient civilisations, mathematics in India began in counting
and drawing: numbers and plane geometry. The earliest textually recorded
geometry is that of the Sulbasutra (around 800 BC onwards) which are
manuals for the construction of Vedic altars, its mathematical high point
being the `theorem of the diagonal', Pythagoras' theorem to you and me. I
will state its earliest formulation and touch briefly on some of the ideas
around it as found in the texts.

The much earlier Indus Valley civilisation had its own geometry (ca 2600 -
1900 BCE) but it has to be read from its ruins - streetscapes, decorated
artefacts and ornaments, etc. - as it has left no readable writing. Recent
work on what can be learned from their study, including the tantalising
possibility of a continuity between Indus and Vedic geometry, will be
described.

The second part of the talk will deal with enumeration. Here the key text,
surprisingly, is the Rgveda (ca 1100 BC) which provides excellent evidence
of a sophisticated and complete decimally based system of counting,
expressed through number names whose precise meaning has to be arrived at
by grammatical analysis . The Indus people very likely counted in base 8
or a combination of base 8 and base 10 and to see any sort of Indus-Vedic
continuity in systems of enumeration seems at present a challenging task.

The field is rich in open questions.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
