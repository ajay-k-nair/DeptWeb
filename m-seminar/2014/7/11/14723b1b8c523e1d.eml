Dear all,

                           Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : Chaitanya Senapathi
          TIFR

Title   : Morse theory on the space of paths on Homogenous spaces

Date    : 11th July, 2014 (Friday)

Time    : 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
1961 Frankel in a novel approach used the curvature of Complex Projective
space to show complex submanifolds of complimentary dimension intersect.
Based on this approach Scheon and Wolfson reproved the Barth-Lefshetz type
theorems using the Morse Theory on the space of paths, in the case the
ambient space is a Hermitian Symmetric Space. In this talk we describe how
to extend their work to a much larger class of Homogenous spaces.

Barth-Lefschetz type theorems are a generalizations of the famous
Lefshetz-Hyperplane theorem to all generalized flag varieties (Homogeneous
spaces that are also algebraic varieties) proved by Sommese and others.


All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
