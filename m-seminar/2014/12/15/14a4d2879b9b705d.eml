Title       : Zagier polynomials and modified N\"{o}rlund polynomials

Date      : 23rd December, 2014 (Wednesday)

Time      : 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

 Abstract: In 1998, Don Zagier studied the 'modified Bernoulli numbers'
 $B_{n}^{*}$ whose 6-periodicity for odd $n$ naturally arose from his new
 proof of the Eichler-Selberg trace formula. These numbers satisfy amusing
 variants of the properties of the ordinary Bernoulli numbers. Recently,
Victor H. Moll, Christophe Vignat and I studied an obvious generalization
of the modified Bernoulli numbers, which we call 'Zagier polynomials'.
These polynomials are also rich in structure, and we have shown that a
theory parallel to that of the ordinary Bernoulli polynomials exists.
Zagier showed that his asymptotic formula for $B_{2n}^{*}$ can be replaced
by an exact formula.

In an ongoing joint work with M. L. Glasser and K. Mahlburg, we have shown
 that an exact formula exists for the Zagier polynomials too. It involves
 Chebyshev polynomials and an infinite series of Bessel function
$Y_{n}(z)$. We also derive Zagier's exact formula as a limiting case of
this general formula, which is interesting in itself. In the second part
of my talk, we will discuss another generalization of the modified
Bernoulli numbers that we recently studied along with A. Kabza, namely
'modified N\"{o}rlund polynomials' $B_{n}^{(\alpha)*}$ ,
$\alpha\in\mathbb{N}$, and obtain their generating function along with
applications.? The talk will include an interesting mix of special
functions, number theory, probability and umbral calculus.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
