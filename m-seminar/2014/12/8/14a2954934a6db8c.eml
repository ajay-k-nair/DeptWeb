Title   : Homogenization of a system of multi-species semilinear
diffusion - reaction equations and moving boundary problems

Abstract:
A porous medium (concrete, soil, rocks, water reservoir, e.g.) is a
multiscale medium where the heterogeneities present in the medium are
characterized by the micro scale and the global behaviors of the medium
are observed by the macro scale. The upscaling from the micro scale to the
macro scale can be done via averaging methods.

In this talk, we consider two models: M1 and M2. In M1 diffusion and
reaction of mobile chemical species are considered in the pore space of a
porous medium. The reactions amongst the species are modeled via mass
action kinetics and the modeling leads to a system of multi-species
diffusion-reaction equations (coupled semilinear partial differential
equations) at the micro scale where the highly nonlinear reaction rate
terms are present at the right hand sides of the system of PDEs, cf. [2].

In model M2, diffusion, advection and reaction of two different types of
mobile species (type I and type II) are considered at the macro scale. The
type II species are supplied via dissolution process due to the presence
of immobile species on the surface of the solid parts. The presence of
both mobile and the immobile species make the model complex and the
modeling yields a system of semilinear partial differential equations
coupled with ordinary differential equations with jump discontinuity. For
both M1 and M2, the existence of a unique positive global weak solution is
shown with the help of a Lyapunov functional, Schaefer's fixed point
theorem and some regularization technique, cf. [2, 3]. Finally with the
help of two-scale convergence and periodic unfolding, M1 and M2 are
upscaled from the micro scale to the macro scale, e.g. [1].

Some numerical simulations will also be shown in this talk, however for
the purpose of illustration, we restrict ourselves to some relatively
simple 2-dimensional situations.
