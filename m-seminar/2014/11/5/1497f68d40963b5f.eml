Dear All,

    We shall have the fourth pair of lectures for the semester in the
eigenfunctions series.

Date: Friday, November 7, 2014.

Time: Lecture I: 2:15 - 3:15 p.m.
      Coffee break: 3:15 p.m. - 3:30 p.m.
      Lecture II: 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.
      High Tea: 4:30 p.m.

Venue: LH-I, Department of Mathematics, IISc.


Lecture I:

Title: Knots, algorithms and linear programming: the quest to solve unknot
recognition in polynomial time

Speaker: A/Prof. Benjamin A. Burton, School of Mathematics and Physics,
The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia


Abstract:

In this talk we explore new approaches to the old and difficult
computational problem of unknot recognition.  Although the best known
algorithms for this problem run in exponential time, there is increasing
evidence that a polynomial time solution might be possible.  We outline
several promising approaches, in which computational geometry, linear
programming and greedy algorithms all play starring roles.

We finish with a new algorithm that combines techniques from topology and
combinatorial optimisation, which is the first to exhibit "real world"
polynomial time behaviour: although it is still exponential time in
theory, exhaustive experimentation shows that this algorithm can solve
unknot recognition for "practical" inputs by running just a linear number
of linear programs.



Lecture II:

Title: The GAP package simpcomp - A toolbox for simplicial complexes.

Speaker: Dr Jonathan Spreer, School of Mathematics and Physics,
The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia


Abstract: simpcomp is an official extension to the computer algebra system
GAP, that is, simpcomp is part of every full GAP installation. The
software allows the user to compute numerous properties of abstract
simplicial complexes such as the f -, g- and h-vectors, the fundamental
group, the automorphism group, (co-)homology, the intersection form, and
many more. It provides functions to generate simplicial complexes from
facet lists, orbit representatives, or permutation groups. In addition,
functions related to slicings and polyhedral Morse theory as well as a
combinatorial version of algebraic blowups and the possibility to resolve
isolated singularities of 4-manifolds are implemented.

In this talk, I will give an overview over the existing features of the
software and also discuss some ongoing projects such as (i) support for
Forman's discrete Morse theory for homology and fundamental group
computations, and (ii) an extension of the features to analyse tightness
of triangulated manifolds.
