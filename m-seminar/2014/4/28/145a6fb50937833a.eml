Title   : HOMOGENEOUS OPERATORS AND SOME IRREDUCIBLE REPRESENTATIONS OF
THE MOBIUS GROUP

Time    : 4:00 - 5:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
In this report, after recalling the definition of the M\"obius group, we
define homogeneous operators, that is, operators $T$ with the property
$\varphi(T)$ is unitarily equivalent to $T$ for all $\varphi$ in the
M\"obius group and prove some properties of homogeneous operators.
Following this,
(i)  we describe isometric operators which are homogeneous.
(ii) we describe the homogeneous operators in the Cowen-Douglas class of
rank 1.
Finally, Multiplier representations which occur in the study of
homogeneous operators are discussed. Following the proof of Kobayashi, the
multiplier representations are shown to be irreducible.


All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
