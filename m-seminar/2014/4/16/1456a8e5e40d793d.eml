ABSTRACT:

By a triangulation of a topological space $X$, we mean a simplicial
complex $K$ whose geometric carrier is homeomorphic to $X$. The
topological properties of the space can be expressed in terms of the
combinatorics of
its triangulation. Simplicial complexes have gained in prominence after the
advent of powerful computers as they are especially suitable for computer
processing. In this regard, it is desirable for a triangulation to be as
efficient as possible. In this thesis we study different notions of
efficiency of triangulations, namely, minimal triangulations, tight
triangulations and tight neighborly triangulations.

a) Minimal Triangulations: A triangulation of a space is called minimal if
it contains minimum number of vertices among all triangulations of the
space. In general, it is hard to construct a minimal triangulation, or to
decide if a given triangulation is minimal. In this work, we present
examples of minimal triangulations of connected sums of sphere bundles
over the circle.
b) Tight Triangulations: A simplicial complex (triangulation) is called
tight w.r.t field $\mathbb{F}$ if for any induced subcomplex, the induced
homology maps from the subcomplex to the whole complex are all injective.
We normally take the field to be $\mathbb{Z}_2$. Tight triangulations have
several desirable properties. In particular any simplex-wise linear
embedding of a tight triangulation (of a PL manifold) is "as convex" as
possible. Conjecturally, tight triangulations of manifolds are minimal,
and it is known to be the case for most tight triangulations of manifolds.
Examples of tight triangulations are extremely rare, and in this thesis we
present a construction of an infinite family of tight triangulations,
which is only the second of its kind known in literature.


c) Tight Neighborly Triangulations: For dimensions three or more, Novik
and Swartz obtained a lower bound on the number of vertices in a
triangulation***********************ALL ARE CORDIALLY

of a manifold, in terms of its first Betti number. Triangulations that meet
this bound are called tight neighborly. The examples of tight
triangulations constructed in the thesis are also tight neighborly. In
addition, it is proved that there is no tight neighborly triangulation of
a manifold with first Betti number equal to two.
