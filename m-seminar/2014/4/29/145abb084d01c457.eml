Title   : An Introduction to Minimal Surfaces

Time    : 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
In this presentation we briefly recall some results on harmonic maps.
Subsequently, we introduce the concept of minimal surfaces. After
exploring a few examples, we mathematically formulate Plateau's problem
regarding the existence of a soap film spanning each closed, simple wire
frame and discuss a solution. In conclusion, certain partial results
regarding the uniqueness of such a soap film are discussed.


All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
