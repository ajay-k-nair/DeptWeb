ABSTRACT

   The representation theory of finite groups is a classical topic. In the
more general context of finite monoids, the theory is more
   complicated, and in fact still under heavy development. However
   there are classes of monoids where, like for groups, the theory
   simplifies, often with a strong combinatorial flavor, which opens the
door for applications.

   In this talk, we will review the elements of the theory and
   algorithmic, mentioning some recent developments and applications, in
particular to the study of certain discrete Markov chains.

   This will be illustrated by concrete computations using the open source
mathematical software system Sage.
