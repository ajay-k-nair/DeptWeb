Dear all,

                           Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : Luz Roncal
          Universidad de La Rioja, Logrono, Spain

Title   : Semigroups and Harmonic Analysis

Date    : 19th August, 2014 (Tuesday)

Time    : 4:00 - 5:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
By using the language of diffusion semigroups, it is possible to define
and study classical operators in harmonic analysis. We introduce and
develop this idea, and show two applications. First, we investigate
fractional integrals and Riesz transforms in compact Riemannian spaces of
rank one. Secondly, we carry out the study of operators associated with a
discrete Laplacian, namely the fractional Laplacian, maximal heat and
Poisson semigroups, square functions, Riesz transforms and conjugate
harmonic functions.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
