Dear all,

                           Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : Siddhartha Gadgil
          IISc

Title   : Dynamics via quasi-homomorphisms

Date    : 22nd August, 2014 (Friday)

Time    : 11:00 a.m. - 12:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
       In dynamics, one studies properties of a map from a space to itself,
up to change of coordinates in the space. Hence it is important to
understand invariants of the map under change of coordinates. An important
such invariant is Poincare's rotation number, associated to invertible maps
from the circle to itself.
       Ghys and others have abstracted the rotation number to give many
other important invariants of dynamical systems by viewing it in terms of so
called quasi-homomorphisms. Quasi-homomorphisms are like homomorphisms,
except that a bounded error is allowed in the definition.
       In this expository lecture I will introduce quasi-homomorphisms and
show some interesting properties, constructions and application, including
an alternative construction of the real numbers (due to Ross Street). I
shall then show how these can be used to construct dynamical invariants, in
particular the rotation number.
      Only basic algebra and analysis are needed as background for this
lecture.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
