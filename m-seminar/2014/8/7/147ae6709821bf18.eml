Abstract:
Harish-Chandra is a mathematician whose name in the history of mathematics
is permanently etched in stone. I will begin by giving a brief account of
his life, and in the second half of the lecture, explain some of the
technical terms used in the first half. This lecture is aimed mainly at
Ph.D. students.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
