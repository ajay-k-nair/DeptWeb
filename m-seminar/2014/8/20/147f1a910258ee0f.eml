Dear all,

                           Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : Radouan Daher
          University of Hassan II, Casablanca, Morocco.

Title   : On a theorem of Titchmarsh

Date    : 26th August, 2014 (Tuesday)

Time    : 4:00 - 5:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
In this talk we discuss about the Fourier transforms of
functions satisfying Lipschitz conditions of certain order. We cover
Fourier transforms on Euclidean spaces, non compact symmetric spaces and
also certain hyper groups.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
