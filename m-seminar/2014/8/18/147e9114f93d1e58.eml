ABSTRACT

We apply crystal theory to affine Schubert calculus, Gromov-Witten
invariants for the complete flag manifold, and the positroid
stratification of the positive Grassmannian. We introduce operators on
decompositions of elements in the type-A affine Weyl group and produce a
crystal reflecting the internal structure of the generalized Young modules
whose Frobenius image is represented by stable Schubert polynomials. We
apply the crystal framework to products of a Schur function with a k-Schur
function, consequently proving that a subclass of 3-point Gromov-Witten
invariants of complete flag varieties for C^n enumerate the highest weight
elements under these operators. Included in this class are the Schubert
structure constants in the (quantum) product of a Schubert polynomial with
a Schur function s_lambda for all |lambda^vee|< n. Another by-product
gives a highest weight formulation for various fusion coefficients of the
Verlinde algebra and for the Schubert decomposition of certain positroid
classes.

This is joint work with Jennifer Morse (http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0320).
