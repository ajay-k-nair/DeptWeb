Dear All,

    We shall have a pair of lectures as part of the eigenfunctions series
- a monthly series aimed at promoting research interactions.

Speaker: Manjunath Krishnapur

Title: The Littlewood-Offord and related problems

Date: Friday, August 22, 2014.

Time: Lecture I: 2:15-3:15 p.m.
      Coffee break 3:15 p.m. -3:20 p.m.
      Lecture II: 3:30-4:30 p.m.

Venue: LH-I, Department of Mathematics, IISc.

Abstract:
       Given n non-zero real numbers v_1,...,v_n, what is the maximum
possible number of subsets {i_1,...,i_k} that can have the same
subset sum v_{i_1}+...+v_{i_n}? Littlewood and Offord raised the
question, showed that the answer is at most 2^nlog(n)/\sqrt{n} and
conjectured that the log(n) can be removed. Erdos proved the
conjecture and raised more questions that have continued to attract
attention, primarily relating the arithmetic structure of
v_1,...,v_n and the maximum number of subsets with a given
subset-sum.

In the first lecture, we shall review and prove several of these results
(due to Littlewood-Offord, Erdos, Moser, Stanley, Halasz, Tao-Vu,
Rudelson-Vershynin...) and show an application to random matrices.

In the second part, we start with a question in random polynomials and see
how it leads to a variant of the Littlewood-Offord problem that has not
been considered before.

Most of the material presented should be accessible to undergraduate
students. Much of the lecture is an outcome of my joint study in summer
with Sourav Sarkar (ISI, Kolkata).
