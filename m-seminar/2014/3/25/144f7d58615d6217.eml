Abstract:
The aim of this thesis is to give explicit descriptions
of the set of proper holomorphic mappings between two complex
manifolds with reasonable restrictions on the domain and target
spaces. Without any restrictions, this problem is intractable
even when posed for domains in C^n. We present results for
special classes of manifolds. We study, broadly, two types of
structure results:

I. Descriptive:
Our first result is a structure theorem for finite proper
holomorphic mappings between products of connected, hyperbolic
open subsets of compact Riemann surfaces. A special case of our
result follows from the techniques used in a classical result
of Remmert and Stein adapted to the above setting. However,
the presence of factors that have no boundary, or boundaries
that consist of a discrete set of points, necessitates the use
of alternative techniques. Specifically: we make use of a
finiteness theorem of Imayoshi.

II. Rigidity:
A famous theorem of H. Alexander proves the non-existence of
non-injective proper holomorphic self-maps of the unit ball
in C^n, n > 1. Several extensions of this result for various
classes of domains have been established since the appearance
of Alexander's result. Our first rigidity result establishes
the non-existence of non-injective proper holomorphic self-maps
of bounded, balanced pseudoconvex domains of finite type (in
the sense of D'Angelo) in C^n, n > 1. This generalizes a result
in C^2 due to Coupet, Pan and Sukhov to higher dimensions. In
higher dimensions, several aspects of their argument do not work.
Instead, we exploit the circular symmetry and a recent result in
complex dynamics by Opshtein.

Our next rigidity result is for bounded symmetric domains. We
prove that a proper holomorphic map between two non-planar
bounded symmetric domains of the same dimension, one of them
being irreducible, is a biholomorphism. Our methods allow us
to give a single, all-encompassing argument that unifies the
various special cases in which this result is known. Furthermore,
our proof of this result does not rely on the fine structure (in
the sense of Wolf et al.) of bounded symmetric domains. Thus, we
are able to apply some of our techniques to more general classes
of domains. We illustrate this through a rigidity result for
certain convex balanced domains whose automorphism groups are
only assumed to be non-compact. For the bounded symmetric
domains, our key tool is that of Jordan triple systems.


All are cordially invited!
