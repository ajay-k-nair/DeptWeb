Title   : Recent progress towards the twin prime conjecture

Date    : 28th March, 2014 (Friday)

Time    : 2:00 - 3:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
A great progress on the twin prime problem was made last year by
Yitang Zhang and it made him famous in Mathematical circles almost
overnight. He proved the existence of a positive real number M such that
there are infinitely many pairs of primes that differ by at most M. The
twin
prime conjecture predicts that M can be taken to be two. I shall give an
overview of the works leading up to Zhang's spectacular achievement.

Title   : Quadrature domains - an introduction

Date    : 28th March, 2014 (Friday)

Time    : 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
Quadrature domains are those on which holomorphic functions satisfy a
generalized mean value equality. The purpose of this talk will be to
reflect on the Schwarz reflection principle and to understand how it leads
to examples of quadrature domains.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
