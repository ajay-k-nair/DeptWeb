Title   : Critical Growth Elliptic Problem with Singular Discontinuous
Nonlinearity in R^2

Date    : 14th March, 2014 (Friday)

Time    : 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
Elliptic problems with discontinuous nonlinearity has its own
difficulties due to the non-differentiability of the associated
functional. Hence, a generalized gradient approach developed by Chang has
been used to solve such problems if the associated functional is known to
be Lipchitz continuous. In this talk, we will consider critical elliptic
problem in a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the simultaneous
presence of a Heaviside type discontinuity and a power-law type
singularity and investigate the existence of multiple positive solutions.
Here discontinuity coupled with singularity does not fit into any of the
known framework and we will discuss our approach employed to obtain
positive solutions.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
