Abstract:
On page 336 in his lost notebook, S. Ramanujan proposes an identity that
may have been devised to attack a divisor problem. Unfortunately, the
identity is vitiated by a divergent series appearing in it. We prove here
a corrected version of Ramanujan's identity. While finding a plausible
explanation for what may have led Ramanujan to consider a series that
appears in this identity, we are led to a connection with a generalization
of the famous summation formula of Voronoï.  One of the ramifications
stemming from this work allows us to obtain a one-variable generalization
of two double Bessel series identities of Ramanujan that were proved only
recently. This is work in progress and is joint with Bruce C. Berndt,
Arindam Roy and Alexandru Zaharescu.

All are cordially invited!
