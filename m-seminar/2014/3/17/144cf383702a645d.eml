Title   : A Posteriori Error Analysis of Discontinuous Galerkin Methods for
Elliptic Variational Inequalities

Date    : 11th March, 2014 (Tuesday)

Time    : 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
Discontinuous Galerkin methods have received a lot of attention
in the past two decades since these are high order accurate and stable
methods which can easily handle complex geometries, irregular meshes with
hanging nodes and different degree polynomial approximation in different
elements. Adaptive algorithms refine the mesh locally in the region where
the solution exhibits irregular behaviour and a posteriori error estimates
are the main tools to steer the adaptive mesh refinement. In this talk, we
present a posteriori error analysis of discontinuous Galerkin methods for
variational inequalities of the first kind and the second kind.
Particularly, we study the obstacle problem and the Signorini problem in
the category of variational inequalities of the first kind and the plate
frictional contact problem for the variational inequality of the second
kind. Numerical examples will be presented to illustrate the theoretical
results.


All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
