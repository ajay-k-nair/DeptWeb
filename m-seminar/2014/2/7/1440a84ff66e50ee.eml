Dear all,

                           Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : Dr. Umesh Dubey
          IISc

Title   : Support data and Balmer spectrum

Date    : 21st Feb, 2014 (Friday)

Time    : 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
Grothendieck and Verdier introduced the notion of triangulated
category to extract homological informations. This structure appear in
many branches of Mathematics. Balmer introduced the notion of spectrum of
tensor triangulated category as classifying support data. This opens a way
for geometric study of theses abstract categorical data. Balmer also
defined the structure sheaf on this spectrum and as an application
reconstructed large class of schemes from the category of perfect
complexes associated with them. In this talk we'll recall Balmer's
construction of spectrum and its application to reconstruction problem.
We'll also discuss computation of Balmer spectrum for some other tensor
triangulated categories obtained in a joint work with Vivek Mallick.


All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
