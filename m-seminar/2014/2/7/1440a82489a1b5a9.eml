Dear all,

                           Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                 COLLOQUIUM



Speaker : Prof. Dr. Martin Kreuzer
          University of Passau, Germany

Title   : Linear Algebra 1.5

Date    : 7th Feb, 2014 (Friday)

Time    : 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
Most algebraist believe they know Linear Algebra.
The purpose of this talk is to indicate that this is not necessarily true.
We show a substantial amount of little known basic Linear Algebra and its
connection to Algebraic Geometry, in particular to the theory of
zero-dimensional subschemes of affine spaces, and to Computer Algebra, in
particular to the task of solving zero-dimensional polynomial systems.
Here are some questions which we will answer in this talk: What are the
big kernel and the small image of an endomorphism? What are its
eigenspaces and generalized eigenspaces if it has no eigenvalues? What is
the kernel of an ideal?  What is a commendable endomorphism? And what is a
commendable family of endomorphisms? How is this connected to curvilinear
and Gorenstein schemes? And how can you use this to solve polynomial
systems?


All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
