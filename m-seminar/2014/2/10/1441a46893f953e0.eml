Dear all,

                           Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : Prof Arijit Chakrabarty
          ISI Delhi

Title   : From random matrices to long range dependence

Date    : 10th Feb, 2014 (Monday)

Time    : 2:00 - 3:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
Random matrices whose entries come from a stationary Gaussian process are
studied. The limiting behavior of the eigenvalues as the size of the
matrix goes to infinity is the main subject of interest in this talk. It
is shown that the limiting spectral distribution is determined by the
absolutely continuous component  of the spectral measure of the stationary
process, a phenomenon resembling that in  the situation where the entries
of the matrix are i.i.d. On the other hand, the discrete component
contributes to the limiting behavior of the eigenvalues in a completely
different way. Therefore, this helps to define a boundary between short
and long range dependence of a stationary Gaussian process in the context
of random matrices.


All are cordially invited!
