Dear all,

Title   : Cryptanalysis of RSA Variants and Implicit Factorization

Date    : 1st May, 2014 (Thursday)

Time    : 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
The famous RSA public key cryptosystem is possibly the most studied topic
in cryptology research. For efficiency and security purposes, some
variants
of the basic RSA has been proposed. In this talk, we will first discuss two
such RSA variants: Prime Power RSA and Common Prime RSA.

We also present new bounds on the parameter choices where these RSA
variants are not secure.

Then we study the Implicit Factorization. This was introduced by May and
Ritzenhofen in PKC 2009 and studied under the assumption that some of
Least Significant Bits (LSBs) of certain primes are the same. Our strategy
can be applied to the implicit factorization problem in a general
framework considering the equality of (i) Most Significant Bits (MSBs)
(ii) Least Significant Bits (LSBs) and (iii) MSBs and LSBs together.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
