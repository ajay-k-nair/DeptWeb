Dear all,

                           Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : Prof. Dr. Martin Kreuzer
          University of Passau, Germany

Title   : Computational Aspects of Bunside Algebras II

Date    : 2nd March, 2015 (Wednesday)

Time    : 2:00 p.m. - 3:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
In this two-part talk, we reconsider Burnside algebras,
a classical tool in the theory of finite groups, from a computational
perspective. Using modern computer algebra systems, many of the results
about these rings that were proved in the second half of the last century
can be transformed into effective algorithms.

After recalling the definition and basic properties of the Bunside ring of
a finite group, we show how to compute an explicit presentation on terms
of generators and relations, how to determine the prime ideal spectrum and
its connected components, and how to relate the Burnside ring to its
normalization by computing its quasi-idempotents.

In the latter parts of the lectures we introduce explicit methods
for computing classical maps between the Burnside rings of related groups
such as the restriction and inflation maps. All algorithms will be
accompanied by actual computations of concrete examples.


All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
