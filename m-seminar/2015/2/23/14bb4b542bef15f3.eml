Dear all,

                           Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : Prof Carsten Carstensen
          Humboldt University, Berlin

Title   : Axioms of Adaptivity

Date    : 23rd February, 2015 (Monday)

Time    : 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
Four axioms (A1)--(A4) link estimators and distance functions on
a set of admissible refinements together and imply optimality of a
standard finite element routine on an abstract level with a loop: solve,
estimate, mark, and refine. The presentation provides proofs and examples
of the recent review due to  C. Carstensen, M. Feischl, M. Page, and D.
Praetorius: The axioms of adaptivity, Comput. Math. Appl. 67 (2014) 1195
--1253 and so discusses the current literature  on the mathematics of
adaptive finite element methods. The presentation concludes with an
overview over several applications of the set of axioms. If time permits,
some recent developments are discussed on ongoing joint work with Hella
Rabus on separate marking.


All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
