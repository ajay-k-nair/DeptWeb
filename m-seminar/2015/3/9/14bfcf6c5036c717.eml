Title   : Arithmetic of Farey-Ford Packings

Time    : 3:30 p.m. - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
Farey-Ford Packings are a special case of more general circle packings
called Apollonian Circle Packings (ACP). These packings have some very
interesting properties, for exmaple, if any four mutually tangent circles
have integer curvatures, then so do all others in the packing. This has
led to many important problems like prime number theorem in this setting.
Kontorovich and Oh explore it from dynamics point of view whereas
Bourgain, Fuchs and Sarnak look at them more number theoretically. In this
talk, our focus will be on the specialized packings Farey-Ford Packings.
We consider some basic statistics associated to these circles and answer
some questions about their distributions and asymptotic behavior. One can
ask similar questions in the general setting for ACP, and if time permits,
we will discuss it in this talk. Some of this is joint work with Athreya,
Chaubey and Zaharescu.


All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
