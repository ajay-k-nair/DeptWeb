Title: Homogenization of Periodic Optimal Control Problems in a Domain
with highly oscillating boundary

Abstract: Homogenization is a branch of science where we try to understand
microscopic structures via a macroscopic medium. Hence, it has
applications in various branches of science and engineering. This study is
basically developed from material science in the creation of composite
materials though the contemporary applications are much far and wide. It
is a process of understanding the microscopic behavior of an
in-homogeneous medium via a homogenized medium. Mathematically, it is a
kind of asymptotic analysis. We plan to start with an illustrative example
of limiting analysis in 1-D for a second order elliptic partial
differential equation. We will also see some classical results in the case
of periodic composite materials and oscillating boundary domain. The
emphasis will be on the computational importance of homogenization in
numerics by the introduction of correctors. In the second part of the
talk, we will see a study on optimal control problems posed in a domain
with highly oscillating boundary. We will consider periodic controls in
the oscillating part of the domain with a model problem of Laplacian and
try to understand their optimality and asymptotic behavior.
