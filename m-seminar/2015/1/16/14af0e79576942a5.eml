Dear all,

                           Department of Mathematics
                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR



Speaker : Sandeep Varma
          TIFR, Mumbai

Title   : On applying the Deligne-Kazhdan philosophy to classical groups

Date    : 29th January, 2015 (Thursday)

Time    : 3:30 - 4:30 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
I will report on work in progress with Radhika Ganapathy. One wishes to
study irreducible `smooth' complex representations of symplectic and
(split) orthogonal groups over local function fields, i.e., fields of the
form F_q((t)). The theory of `close local fields' proposes to do this by
studying the representation theory of these groups over (varying) finite
extensions of Q_p. We will discuss an approach to using this philosophy
to study the local Langlands correspondence for these groups.

All are cordially invited!

Chairman,
Department of Mathematics
