Title:  Lengths of Monotone Subsequences in a Mallows Permutation

Abstract:
The longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of a uniformly random permutation
is a well studied problem. Vershik-Kerov and Logan-Shepp first showed that
asymptotically the typical length of the LIS is 2sqrt(n). This line of
research culminated in the work of Baik-Deift-Johansson who related this
length to the Tracy-Widom distribution.

We study the length of the LIS and LDS of random permutations drawn from
the Mallows measure, introduced by Mallows in connection with ranking
problems in statistics. Under this measure, the probability of a
permutation p in S_n is proportional to q^Inv(p) where q is a real
parameter and Inv(p) is the number of inversions in p. We determine the
typical order of magnitude of the LIS and LDS, large deviation bounds for
these lengths and a law of large numbers for the LIS for various regimes
of the parameter q.

This is joint work with Ron Peled.

Title: From Trees to Seeds - on the inference of the seed from large
random trees.


Abstract:
We study the influence of the seed in random trees grown according to the
uniform and preferential attachment  models. The basic question is : do
different seeds lead to the same distributional limit? The talk will be
based on joint work with Bubeck and Racz, joint work with Bubeck, Eldan
and Racz and work by Curien, Duquesne, Kortchemski, and Manolescu.
