Title: Hochschild and cyclic homology of algebraic non-commutative torus
orbifold and Chern-Connes pairing.

Speaker: Safdar Quddus (NISER, Odisha)

Abstract: The algebraic non-commutative torus gives via the action of
Z/2Z, Z/3Z, Z/4Z and Z/6Z, four orbifolds. The Hochschild and cyclic
cohomology of smooth non-commutative torus were computed by Connes in
1985. We calculate the these homologies for algebraic orbiolfds, we also
study the Chern-Connes pairing, which is a generalised understanding of
the classical Chern pairing/index. While Chern index was a useful
imvariant in the classical case, so is Chern-Connes pairing in the
non-commutative setup. We compute the Chern-Connes index for the algebraic
non-commutative Z/2Z torus orbifold.
