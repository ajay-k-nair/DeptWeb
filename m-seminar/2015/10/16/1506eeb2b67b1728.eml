Dear All,


There will be two lectures in the Eigenfunctions seminar today, 16th 
Oct, 2015.

--------------------------------------------
Lectue 1:

Speaker: K Sandeep (TIFR-CAM)

Title : Nonlinear analysis and PDE

Time and venue: 16 Oct, 2:15 PM, LH-1, Dept of mathematics

Abstract : It is well known that finding an explicit solution for partial
differential equations is almost impossible in most of the cases. In this
talk we will give a brief introduction to the analysis of certain
nonlinear PDEs using various tools from analysis. We will discuss some
concrete examples and some open problems (depending on time).
The talk should be accessible to senior undergraduate students.

------------------------------

Lecture 2:

Speaker: Siddhartha Gadgil (IISc)

Title: Homotopy type theory

Time and venue: 16 Oct, 3:30 PM, LH-1, Dept of mathematics

Abstract: The usual foundations of mathematics based on Set theory and 
Predicate calculus (and extended by category theory), while successful in 
many ways, are so far removed from everyday mathematics that the 
possibility of translation of theorems to their formal counterparts is 
generally purely a matter of faith. Homotopy type theory gives alternative 
foundations for mathematics. These are based on an extension of type 
theory (from logic and computer science) using an unexpectedly deep 
connection of Types with Spaces discovered by Voevodsky and Awodey-Warren. 
As a consequence of this relation we also obtain a synthetic view of 
homotopy theory.
    In this lecture, I will give a brief introduction to this young 
subject.
