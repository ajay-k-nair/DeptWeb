Title: Finite configurations in sparse sets

Location: LH-1

Abstract: A problem of interest in geometric measure theory both in
discrete and continuous settings is the identification of algebraic and
geometric patterns in thin sets. The first two lectures will be a survey of
the literature on pattern recognition in sparse sets, with a greater
emphasis on continuum problems. The second two contain an exposition of
recent work, joint in part with Vincent Chan, Kevin Henriot and Izabella
Laba on the existence of linear and polynomial configurations in
multi-dimensional Lebesgue-null sets satisfying appropriate Hausdorff and
Fourier dimensionality conditions.
