Title: AN INTRODUCTION TO ATLAS: BASIC BACKGROUND AND APPLICATIONS

Speaker: JONATHAN FERNANDES

Date: Aug 14, 2015

Time: 4pm

Location: LH-1

Abstract. Let G_R be the real points of a complex connected reductive al-
gebraic group G defined over R. The Atlas Software is a computational tool,
primarily designed to compute signatures of hermitian forms on hermitian
representations of G_R. The output of the software can be used to compute
a lot more than just Hermitian forms.

In this talk, we will introduce some basic terminology used by the software.

For groups of small rank, starting with SL(2, R), we will analyze its
representations and their invariants using the software – understanding
the parameters that define a representation, compute it’s infinitesimal
character, character formula, composition series, the lowest K-Type, other
K-types, check for unitarity etc.
