Title: " Existence of Nash equilibrium for
chance-constrained games"

Abstract:
We consider an n-player strategic game with finite action sets. The payoffs
of each player are random variables. We assume that each player uses a
satisficing payoff criterion defined by a chance-constraint, i.e., players
face a chance-constrained game. We consider the cases where payoffs follow
normal and elliptically symmetric distributions. For both cases we show
that there always exists a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium of corresponding
chance-constrained game.
