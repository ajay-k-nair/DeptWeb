Title: Functional equation for Selmer groups

Date & time: Nov 30 (Monday) from 4-5 PM

Location: LH-1

Speaker: Somnath Jha (IIT, Kanpur)

Abstract: Interplay between arithmetic and analytic objects are some of
the beautiful aspects of number theory. In this talk, we will discuss
several examples of this.

In particular, we will discuss a 'functional equation' for  Selmer groups.
