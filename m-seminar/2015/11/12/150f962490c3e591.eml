Title: Exploring parameterised complexity in computational topology

Speaker: Benjamin A. Burton, The University of Queensland, Australia

Date: Nov 12

Time : 4:00 pm

Location: LH 1

Abstract: Exact computation with knots and 3-manifolds is challenging -
many fundamental
problems are decidable but enormously complex, and many major algorithms
have never
been implemented.  Even "simple" problems, such as unknot recognition
(testing whether a
loop of string is knotted), or 3-sphere recognition (testing whether a
triangulated 3-manifold is
topologically trivial), have best-known algorithms that are worst-case
exponential time.

In practice, however, modern software packages can solve many complex
topological
problems that "should" be intractable.  In this talk we discuss how
parameterised complexity
is emerging as a framework for understanding this surprising behaviour.
We also discuss
the rise of parameterised complexity as a practical tool for designing
topological algorithms,
and we discuss the interplay between topology, graph theory and logic that
makes this
possible.
