Title: The restriction of discrete series representations to minimal
parabolic subgroups - the case of Spin(4,1)

Speaker Aprameyan Parthasarthy, Universitat Paderborn, Germany

Date: Sept 30, 2015

Time: 4pm

Location: LH1

Abstract:  In this talk we'll discuss  some ideas concerning the
restriction problem discrete series representations of a real
reductive  group G  to a  (minimal)  parabolic subgroup  P.  As  a first
example in  the non-Hermitian  case, we study  Spin(4,1) -  an example
that is interesting  in itself, and also serves as  a test case for
our general  strategy.  Motivated by geometric  considerations we show
that  only finitely  many discrete  series of  P appear  with non-zero
multiplicity in  the restriction, in  contrast to the  Hermitian case.
Our  work  is  related  to  certain conjectures  of  Duflo  about  the
geometric nature  of the Plancherel  theorem. This is joint  work with
Gang Liu (Uni. Metz, France).
