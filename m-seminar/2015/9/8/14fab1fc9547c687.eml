Title: Iwasawa theory and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture:

Abstract: The celebrated BSD conjecture predicts a deep and mysterious
relationship between the algebraic rank of an elliptic curve
defined over a number field and an arithmetic invariant arising
front he L-function of the elliptic curve. More amazingly, it
predicts an exact formula for the leading term of the L-function.
Iwasawa theory has proven to be an effective tool in trying to
explain the philosophy behind such a mysterious relationship and
also in establishing the conjecture in certain cases. We shall
outline this theory and discuss  its applications.
