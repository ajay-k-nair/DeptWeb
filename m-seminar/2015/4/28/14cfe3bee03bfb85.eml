Dear all,

                    Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore


                                    SEMINAR

Title   : Equivariant Cobordism Classes of Milnor Manifolds

Date    : 28th April, 2015 (Tuesday)

Time    : 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.

Venue   : Lecture Hall I, Department of Mathematics

Abstract:
Let G be a 2-group, and let Z(G) denote the equivariant cobordism
algebra of G-manifolds with finite stationary point sets.A cobordism class
in Z(G) is said to be indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the sum
of products of lower dimensional cobordism classes.Indecomposable classes
generate the cobordism algebra Z(G). We discuss a sufficient criteria for
indecomposability of cobordism classes.
Using the above mentioned criterion, we show that the classes of Milnor
manifolds (i.e., degree 1 hypersurfaces of the product of two real
projective spaces) give non-trivial, indecomposable elements in Z(G) in
degrees up to 2^n - 5.
This talk is based on joint work with Samik Basu and Goutam Mukherjee.



All are cordially invited!
