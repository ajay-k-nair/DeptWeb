Title: Random Matrices, Numerical Computation, and Applications

Date: June 3

Time: 4-5 pm

Location: LH1

Speaker: Alan Edelman (MIT)

Abstract: This talk is about random matrix theory.  Linear Algebra and
maybe a little probability are the only prerequisites.  Random matrix
theory is now finding many applications.  Many more applications remain to
be found. It is truly "matrix statistics," when traditional statistics has
been primarily "scalar" and "vector" statistics.  The math is so much
richer, and the applications to computational finance, HIV research, the
Riemann Zeta Function, and crystal growth, to name a few, show how
important this area is.  I will show some of these applications, and
invite you to find some of your own.

  For me, there has been an exciting lesson.  It has to do with the
interplay between mathematics and computation.   The computer plays many
roles in mathematics. It provides experimental data to suggest, confirm, or
discard potential theorems.  It provides simulations to bring cold theorems
to life.  It illustrates in detail the exact nature
of particular solutions.

Julia is emerging as a major computational language in many areas
including random matrix theory. This talk will show why.
