Title: Title: Landstad-Vaes theory for locally compact quantum groups

Abstract: In the seventies of last century, Magnus Landstad characterised
the coefficient C*-algebra
inside the multiplier algebra of a given crossed product C*-algebra
subject to an action of an Abelian locally compact group G. In 2005,
Stefaan Vaes extended the Landstad theory for "regular locally compact
quantum groups". He gave strong indications that this is not possible for
non-regular groups. In this talk I shall explain how Landstad-Vaes theory
extends for non-regular groups. To this end we have to consider not
necessary continuous, but measurable, actions of locally compact quantum
groups. For regular locally compact quantum groups any measurable action
is continuous, so our theory contains that of Landstad-Vaes. This is a
joint work with Stanislaw Lech Woronowicz.
