Title: Dual pairs and intertwining distributions

Abstract: A reductive dual pair in the group Sp(W) of isometries of a
symplectic space W, over a local

field of characteristic not 2, is a pair of subgroups G, G0 of Sp(W) which
act reductively on

W and are centralizers of each others. In the 70ies, Roger Howe made (and
later proved over

the reals; for p-adics with p odd it was done by Jean-Loup Walsburger and
for p =3D 2 by Wee

Teck Gan this year) the conjecture that for any reductive dual pair G, G0

a one-to-one correspondence of irreducible admissible representations of
the lifts of G and G0

inside a certain two-fold covering group of Sp(W), the metaplectic group.
The main problem,

still open, is to understand this correspondence. Many different
approaches have been used

to describe Howe=E2=80=99s correspondence by means of objects associated wi=
th
representations, such

as Langlands parameters, orbits, characters or infinitesimal characters.

The so-called intertwining distributions are special tempered
distributions on the symplectic

space W which are naturally linked to pairs of representations occurring
in Howe=E2=80=99s corre-
spondence over the reals. They are a tool to understand this
correspondence at the level of

characters. We shall explain this in the case where the group G is
compact. This is a joint

work with Mark McKee and Tomasz Przebinda.
