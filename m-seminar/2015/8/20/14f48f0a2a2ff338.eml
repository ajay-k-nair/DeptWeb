Title: Gohberg Lemma, Compactness and Essential Spectrum of Operators on
Compact Lie Groups

Speaker: Aparajita Dasgupta (EPFL, Lausanne)

Abstract: In this talk we prove a version of the Gohberg lemma on compact
Lie groups giving an estimate from below for the distance from a given
operator to the set of compact operators on compact Lie groups. As a
consequence, we prove several results on bounds for the essential spectrum
and a criterion for an operator to be compact. The conditions are given in
terms of the matrix-valued symbols of operators. (This is a joint work
with Professor Michael Ruzhansky.)
