     your dice


       Dear all,

       Amit apte (icts), Sandeep Krishna (ncbs) and Shashi thutupalli (ncbs+icts) 
       are very happy to announce the last talk of 2016 in the **dynamics 
       fridays** seminar series.

       Title: Molecular Dice

       Speaker: Santosh Ansumali, jncasr

       Abstract: good quality pseudo-random numbers are at the heart of many computer simulation methodologies in science and engineering. Most algorithms for
       generating random numbers use techniques from number theory to produce uniformly distributed integers which are, in turn, transformed using expensive
       algebraic operations to obtain numbers corresponding to other distributions. We present a new technique which utilizes the apparent stochasticity inherent in
       dynamical systems and directly generates random numbers following a variety of distributions characterizing the physics of many-body systems. This new
       methodology provides a physical alternate to number theory based random number generators. As an illustration, we demonstrate that our algorithm 
       generates Gaussian distributed random numbers more than order-of-magnitude faster than currently known algorithms.

       Where: simons center ground floor, ncbs

       When: 15:00 on Fri 02 dec 2016

       hope to see you all this friday at ncbs. (playing dice is optional!) 
       please announce this to other people who you think might be interested.

       -amit, sandeep, shashi

       p.s. about the series:

       **dynamics fridays** -- a seminar series about complex systems, dynamical 
       systems, and computer science approaches to various problems, particularly 
       in biology and physics.

       the format: informal, (preferably) chalk board talks with the aim of 
       stimulating discussion. new results and ideas rather than completed 
       projects / polished presentations are particularly encouraged. talks are 
       about an hour long.

       when is it: fridays at 15:00 (once every 4 weeks)

       where is it: alternating between ncbs (ground floor of simons centre) and 
       icts (usually emmy noether room).
