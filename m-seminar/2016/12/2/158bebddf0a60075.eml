Title - Entrywise functions preserving positivity:
Connections between analysis, algebra, and combinatorics


Abstract -
What functions preserve positive semidefiniteness (psd) when applied
entrywise to psd matrices? This question has a long history beginning with
Schur, Schoenberg, and Rudin, and has also recently received renewed
attention due to its applications in high-dimensional statistics. However,
effective characterizations of entrywise functions preserving positivity
in a fixed dimension remain elusive to date.

I will present recent progress on this question, obtained by: (a) imposing
rank and sparsity constraints, (b) restricting to structured matrices, and
(c) restricting the class of functions to special families such as
polynomials or power functions. These constraints arise in theory as well
as applications, and provide natural ways to relax the elusive original
problem. Moreover, novel connections to symmetric function theory, matrix
analysis, and combinatorics emerge out of these refinements.
