Title: Homological Algebra of Ideals Related to Finite Simple Graphs.

Date: December 27, 2016

Time : 3 pm

Location : LH-1


Abstract: Given any finite simple graph G one can naturally associate two
ideals,
namely the edge ideal I(G) and the binomial edge ideal J_G in suitable
polynomial
rings. In this talk we shall discuss the interplay between combinatorics
of the graph
and depth and regularity of I(G), J_G and their powers. Some recent
progress and
some open problems will be discussed.
