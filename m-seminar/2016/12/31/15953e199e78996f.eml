Title: On some fourth order equations associated to Physics.

Abstract: We consider a fourth order traveling wave equation associated to
the Suspension Bridge Problem (SBP). This equations are modeled by the
traveling wave behavior on the Narrows Tacoma and the Golden Gate bridge.
We prove existence of homoclinic solutions when the wave speed is small.
We will also discuss the associated  fourth order Liouville theorem to the
problem and possible link with the De Giorgi's conjecture.  This is an
attempt to prove the McKenna-Walter conjecture which is open for the last
two decades.
