Title: Upscaling of a System of Semilinear Diffusion&#8208;Reaction
Equations in a Heterogeneous Medium: Multi&#8208;Scale Modeling and
Periodic Homogenization.

Abstract: A porous medium (concrete, soil, rocks, water reservoir, e.g.)
is a multi&#8208;scale medium

where the heterogeneities present in the medium are characterized by the
micro scale and the

global behaviors of the medium are observed at the macro scale. The
upscaling from the micro

scale to the macro scale can be done via averaging methods.

In this talk, diffusion and reaction of several mobile chemical species
are considered in

the pore space of a heterogeneous porous medium. The reactions amongst the
species are

modelled via mass action kinetics and the modelling leads to a system of
multi&#8208;species diffusion&#8208;

reaction equations (coupled semi&#8208;linear partial differential
equations) at the micro scale where

the highly nonlinear reaction rate terms are present at the right hand
sides of the system of PDEs,

cf. [2]. The existence of a unique positive global weak solution is shown
with the help of a

Lyapunov functional, Schaefer’s fixed point theorem and maximal
Lp&#8208;regularity, cf. [2, 3]. Finally,

with the help of periodic homogenization and two&#8208;scale convergence
we upscale the model from

the micro scale to the macro scale, e.g. [1, 3]. Some numerical
simulations will also be shown in

this talk, however for the purpose of illustration, we restrict ourselves
to some relatively simple  dimensional situations.

As an extension to the previous model, we consider the mixture of two
fluids. For such

models, a system of Stokes ;Cahn ;Hilliard equations will be
considered at the micro scale in a

perforated porous medium. We first explain the periodic setting of the
model and the existence

results. At the end homogenization of the model will be shown using some
extension theorems

on Sobolev spaces, two&#8208;scale convergence and periodic unfolding.
