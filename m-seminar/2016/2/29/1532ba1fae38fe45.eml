Title: Wild Topology, Group Theory and a conjecture in Number Theory<br>
<br>
Date and Time: Wednesday, March 2, 2016, 4:00 p.m.<br>
<br>
Venue: LH-1, Department of Mathematics<br>
<br>
Abstract: One of the most useful analogies in mathematics is the<br>
fundamental group functor (also known as the Galois Correspondence) which<b=
r>
sends a topological space to its fundamental group while at the same time<b=
r>
sending continuous maps between spaces to corresponding homomorphisms of<br>
groups in such a way that compositions of maps are preserved.<br>
<br>
A an obvious question one might ask is whether the fundamental group<br>
functor is &quot;onto&quot;, that is: (1) is every group the fundamental gr=
oup of a<br>
space and (2) every homomorphism the image of a continuous map between<br>
corresponding spaces?=C2=A0 The easy answer to (1) is &quot;yes&quot; and t=
he nonobvious<br>
answer to (2) is &quot;it depends on the spaces&quot;.<br>
<br>
We&#39;ll introduce the harmonic archipelago as the shining example of a sp=
ace<br>
with a strange fundamental group, define an archipelago of groups as a<br>
group theoretic<br>
product operation and finally describe how such products are (almost) all<b=
r>
isomorphic to the fundamental group of the harmonic archipelago.<br>
<br>
We will study examples showing that there are group homomorphisms that<br>
cannot be induced by continuous maps on certain spaces and how the<br>
fundamental group of the harmonic archipelago factors through all such<br>
&quot;discontinuous homomorphisms&quot;, how none of the examples is constr=
uctible<br>
(or even understandable in any reasonable way) and how one might detect<br>
spaces whose fundamental group allows them to be the codomain of such weird=
<br>
homomorphisms (the conjecture is that they contain the rational numbers or<=
br>
torsion).<br>
<br>
We&#39;ll talk a bit about the notion of cotorsion groups from classical<br>
Abelian group theory and how that notion can be generalized to non-Abelian<=
br>
groups by requiring certain types of systems of equations have solutions<br>
and then mention how countable groups which have solutions to such systems<=
br>
are always images of the fundamental group of an archipelago.<br>
<br>
In the end we&#39;re lead to an example of a countable group which we can p=
rove<br>
is either the rational numbers or gives a counterexample to a nearly 50<br>
year old conjecture in number theory:=C2=A0 the Kurepa conjecture.=C2=A0 So=
 there is<br>
a little topology, a little homotopy theory, some group theory, a pinch of<=
br>
logic and a wisp of number theory in the talk.=C2=A0 This is a distillation=
 of<br>
work I&#39;ve published recently with Hojka and Meilstrup (Proc AMS) and wo=
