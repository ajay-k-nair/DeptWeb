Dear All,

There will be two lectures in the "Eigenfunctions" seminar series on 26th 
Feb, 2015.

--------------------------------------------
Lecture 1:

Speaker: Rukmini Dey (ICTS, Bangalore)

Title: Some Aspects of Minimal Surfaces

Time and date: 2:15-3:15 PM, 26th Feb

Venue: LH-1, department of mathematics

Abstract: I will introduce minimal surfaces  and explain the 
Weierstrass-Enneper representation of a minimal surface using hodographic 
coordinates. I will mention an interesting link between minimal surfaces 
and Born-Infeld solitons. If time permits, I will explain my work (with P 
Kumar and R K Singh) on interpolation of two real analytic curves by a 
minimal surface of the Bj\"{o}rling-Schwartz type.

Lecture 2:

Speaker: Deeparnab Chakrabarty (Microsoft research, Bangalore)

Title: Understanding Wolfe¢s Heuristic: Submodular Function Minimization 
and Projection onto Polytopes

Time and date: 3:30-4:30 PM, 26th Feb

Venue: LH-1, department of mathematics

Abstract:  Owing to several applications in large scale learning and 
vision problems, fast submodular function minimization (SFM) has become a 
very important problem. Theoretically, unconstrained SFM is polynomial 
time solvable, however, these algorithms are not practical. In 1976, Wolfe 
proposed a heuristic for projection onto a polytope, and in 1980, 
Fujishige showed how Wolfe's heuristic can be used for SFM. For general 
submodular functions, this Fujishige-Wolfe heuristic seems to have the 
best empirical performance. Despite its good practical performance, very 
little is known about Wolfe's projection algorithm theoretically.

In this talk, I will describe the first analysis which proves that the 
heuristic is polynomial time for bounded submodular functions. Our work 
involves the first convergence analysis of Wolfe¢s projection heuristic, 
and proving a robust version of Fujishige¢s reduction theorem.
