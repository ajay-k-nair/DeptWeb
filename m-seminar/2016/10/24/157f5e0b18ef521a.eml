Dear All,

  This is a gentle (!) reminder that Shane D' Mello who is currently a
postdoc at IISER Pune will be giving a talk on Tuesday (tomorrow), Oct 25
from 4-5 pm in LH 1. Here are the title and the abstract.

 Title: Some results on the topology of real algebraic curves

 Abstract: The topology of real algebraic varieties is the study of the
topology of objects that can be defined real algebraically and particularly
the restrictions that the real algebraic structure imposes on the topology.
Hilbert's famous address motivated an interest in the so called Hilbert's
sixteenth problem of classifying, up to isotopy, real algebraic curves of a
given degree. While successful only up to degree 7, it has motivated many
natural and interesting questions and generalizations.
               We will  look at some of these questions including a
criterion for curves that have the maximum permissible number of components
in terms of the Jacobian of the complexification of the curve, the
reduction of the classification of real planar rational quartics to the
simple combinatorial classification of  "extended" chord diagrams, the
classification of real rational knots of low degrees, and an application of
braid groups in constructing real rational representatives of knots.

Thanking you,
Vamsi
