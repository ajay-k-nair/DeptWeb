Dear all,

This week in the Simons Assorted Math Open Seminar there will be a talk at
4 in the Simons Center ground floor by Manjunath Krishnapur, Associate
Professor of Mathematics, IISc. As always, tea and snacks before.

Speaker: Manjunath Krishnapur, IISc math

Title: Some themes in basic probability

Abstract: We believe that some insights of probability theory are of
general interest. Examples are the principle of large deviations, uses of
martingales, concentration of measure, Markovian dependence, etc. An
attempt will be made to explain what some of these concepts mean. We
attempt to keep the mathematics as simple as possible. Warning: There will
not be much new for people who have studied probability at the level of a
graduate course.
