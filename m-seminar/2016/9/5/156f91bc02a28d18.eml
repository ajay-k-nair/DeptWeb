Title: Tropical Algebraic Geometry: an Introduction.


Abstract:  We start with a gentle introduction to tropical algebraic
geometry.  We then focus on the tropical lifting problem and discuss
recent progress. Tropical analogues of graph curves play an important role
in this study. This talk will be accessible to the general mathematical
audience.
