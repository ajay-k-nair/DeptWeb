Previous time, many people came to ask me where the talk is and how to get 
there: It is at NCBS, there are regular shuttles from and to IISc
   https://www.ncbs.res.in/shuttle_trips

Manjunath.

May I trouble you to again send around the announcement?

Dear all,

[Note for those coming from outside NCBS: there is a 3:15 shuttle
departing from the parking lot in front of the IISc library that
reaches just before the talk.  There are return shuttles at 6 and 630
(and later)]

The second talk in the Simons Assorted Mathematics Open SEminar will be
this Friday, 30 September, at 4pm (tea 3:45) in the Simons Center ground
floor.

Arvind Ayyer, Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the Indian Institute
of Science, will deliver the following talk:

An exactly solvable stochastic model of motor transport

Abstract:
Various kinds of one-dimensional transport processes occur in the cell.
One such class involves the transport of molecular cargo to and from the
cell wall to the interior on filaments. Prominent examples include dynein
and kinesin on microtubules and myosin on actin. We will consider a toy
model that might prove useful in studying cellular transport.

After a quick review of finite Markov processes, we will describe a
one-dimensional lattice model of particle transport with reservoirs on
both ends called the TASEP (totally asymmetric simple exclusion process).
In the mid 90s, this model was solved exactly by Derrida et. al. using a
novel technique known as the matrix ansatz. Using this approach, the phase
diagram can be computed exactly.

Time permitting, we will define a generalised model with two species of
particles, which we will also solve using the matrix ansatz and calculate
its phase diagram. This part is joint work with J. Lebowitz and E. R.
Speer.
