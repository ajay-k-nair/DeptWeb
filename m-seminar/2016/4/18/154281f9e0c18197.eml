Dear All,

There will be two lectures in the "Eigenfunctions" seminar series on=20
friday, 22nd April 2016.

--------------------------------------------
Lecture 1:

Speaker: Sreekar Vadlamani (TIFR-CAM, Bangalore)

Title: Some aspects of integral geometry

Time and date: 2:15-3:15 PM, 22nd Apr.

Venue: LH-1, department of mathematics

Abstract: One of the earliest instance of integral geometric discussion=20
can be traced back to Buffon through the "needle problem". The solution,=20
as we know now, is based on a platform of theory of measures on=20
geometrical spaces which are invariant under some group operations.
In this talk, we shall walk through this subject by following a specific=20
line of problems/results called "kinematic fundamental formulae" by=20
studying some specific examples.

------------------------------
Lecture 2:

Speaker: Krishna Maddaly (IMSc, Chennai)

Title: Inverse spectral theory

Time and date: 3:30-4:30 PM, 22nd Apr.

Venue: LH-1, department of mathematics

Abstract: Inverse spectral theory in one dimension is to recover a=20
self-adjoint operator given its spectrum and some spectral measure. In=
=20
general there are lots of self-adjoint operators (of a given form) this=20
collection is called an iso-spectral set. We will give a brief=20
introduction to the questions in this area and also some connections to=20
other areas of mathematics.



All are welcome
    CHAIRMAN
