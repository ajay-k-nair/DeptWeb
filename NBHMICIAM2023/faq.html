	Questions specific to the test and subsequent interview
</font>
</H2>  -->
<p>
Question:  Is current affiliation a consideration for the sponsorship?
<br>
<font color="black">
Answer:  Yes.   The sponsorship is open only to regular full-time members of research institutions / universities / colleges in India.  Post-doctoral fellows, doctoral students, and faculty on contract are considered regular members for its purposes.
</font>
</p>

<p>
Question:  What if I don't have a passport yet?
<br>
<font color="black">
Answer:   You are well advised to apply for it immediately.   You may respond with "Applied for" (to the question on the application form that asks for your passport number).
</font>
</p>

<p>
Question:  What is meant by the "institutional bank account authorised to receive grant funds"?   How do I find the details of that account?
<br>
<font color="black">
Answer:   The NBHM grant money can only be transferred to an account belonging to your institution (and not to any personal account).      Typically an institution will have several accounts to receive funds from various grants.   Contact the administration of your institution for details of the correct account.   Your application will not be complete without them being filled in.

Question:
I am scheduled to attend a satellite conference of the ICM.    Could the travel grant under this scheme include travel to such a conference?
<br>
<font color="black">
The scope of this scheme of the NBHM covers only round trip travel between the candidate's work place in India and St. Petersburg (the venue of the ICM).     It does not in general cover travel to the satellite conferences of the ICM. However, your travel via a satellite conference to or from the ICM might possibly be covered (subject to an upper limit) on a case-by-case basis. You are welcome to apply and await the results.

<p>
Question: I am scheduled to attend a satellite conference of the ICM. I already have a Chebyshev grant. Can I get support from NBHM for travel to this satellite conference?
<br>
<font color="black"> 
	If your travel to the ICM is already covered by another grant and you are looking for support from NBHM for travel to a satellite conference,    this scheme would not be the appropriate one to apply for.   Instead,  you may consider the <a href="http://www.nbhm.dae.gov.in/travel.html", target="_blank">NBHM travel grant</a>.

<p>
Question:  Is nationality a consideration for the sponsorship?
<br>
<font color="black">
Answer:   Only to the extent that, all other things being equal, an Indian national would have higher priority than a foreigner.
</font>
</p>

<!--
<p>
Question:  I am an Indian national. I finished my PhD abroad in October 2021 and, since 01 Jan 2022,  I am a pdf here in India.   Am I eligible?
<br>
<font color="black">
Answer:  Yes,  you are eligible.    However,  you would have lower priority than somebody who, say, finished a PhD in India around the same time as you and now has the same position as you (all other things being equal).
