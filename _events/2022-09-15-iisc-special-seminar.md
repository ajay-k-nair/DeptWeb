_Title:_ "Monodromy and approach to equilibrium for viscoelastic models allowing microstructure"

_Abstract:_
For certain models of one-dimensional viscoelasticity, there are infinitely many equilibria
representing phase mixtures. In order to prove convergence as time tends to infinity of solutions
to a single equilibrium, it seems necessary to impose a nondegeneracy condition on the
constitutive equation for the stress. The talk will explain this, and show how in some cases
the nondegeneracy condition can be proved using the monodromy group of a holomorphic function.
This is joint work with Inna Capdeboscq and Yasemin Şengül.
