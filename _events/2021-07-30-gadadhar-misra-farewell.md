### Abstracts

#### Lecture 1 ​

__Speaker:__ Sameer Chavan (IIT Kanpur)

__Title:__ ​ Positivity aspects of Dirichlet series

__Abstract:__ In the first half of this talk, we discuss the space $\mathcal D[s]$
of finite Dirichlet series considered as a subspace of continuous functions on
$\mathbb R_+$. Unlike the space of polynomials, $\mathcal D[s]$ fails to be an
adapted space in the sense of Choquet. This causes an obstruction in identifying
all positive linear functionals on $\mathcal D[s]$ as moment functionals (an analog
of the so-called Riesz--Haviland Theorem). One solution (direct) to this problem
can be based on a well-known one-point compactification technique in moment theory.
Another solution (rather indirect) takes us to the topics like $\log$-moment
sequences and Helson matrices of independent interest. In the second half, we focus
on half-plane analog of the weighted Hardy spaces. The motivating example comes from
the Riemann zeta function. We address the problem of finding members/multipliers of
these spaces.

#### Lecture 2​

__Speaker:__ Somnath Hazra (IISER Kolkata)

__Title:__ ​ A family of homogeneous operators in the Cowen--Douglas class over the poly-disc

__Abstract:__ ​  In this talk, we first describe a family of reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces of holomorphic functions taking values in $\mathbb{C}^r$ on the unit poly-disc
$\mathbb{D}^n$ depending upon $r+n$ parameters of positive real numbers for any natural
number $r$. It is then shown that these reproducing kernels are quasi-invariant with
respect to the subgroup M&ouml;b$\times\cdots\times$M&ouml;b ($n$ times) of the bi-holomorphic
automorphism group of $\mathbb{D}^n$. Using the quasi-invariant property, these reproducing
kernels can be described explicitly. The adjoint of the $n$-tuples of multiplication operators
by co-ordinate functions on these Hilbert spaces turn out to be homogeneous, irreducible,
mutually unitarily inequivalent and in the Cowen-Douglas class over $\mathbb{D}^n$.

__Speaker:__ Rajeev Gupta (IIT Goa)

__Title:__ ​ The Caratheodory--Fejer interpolation on the polydisc

__Abstract:__ CF-Problem: Given any polynomial $p$ in $n$-variables of degree $d$, find necessary
and sufficient conditions on the coefficients of $p$ to ensure the existence of a holomorphic
function $h$ defined on the polydisc such that $f:=p+h$ maps the polydisc into the unit disc in the
complex plane and that for any multi-index $I$ with length at most $d$ $h^{(I)}(\boldsymbol 0)=0.$ 
In this talk, we give an algorithm for finding a solution to the Caratheodory--Fejer interpolation
problem on the polydisc, whenever it exists. A necessary condition for the existence of a solution
becomes apparent from this algorithm. Along the way a generalization of the well-known theorem
due to Nehari will be obtained.

#### Lecture 4

__Speaker:__ Surjit Kumar (IISc Bangalore)

__Title:__ ​ $K$-homogeneous tuple of operators on bounded symmetric domains

__Abstract:__ In this talk, we discuss Hilbert space operator tuples which are homogeneous under
the action of a compact linear group.

Let $\Omega$ be an irreducible bounded symmetric domain of rank $r$ in $\mathbb C^d$ and $K$ is a
maximal compact subgroup of the identity component $G$ of the biholomorphic automorphism group of
the domain $\Omega$. The group $K$ consisting of linear transformations acts naturally on any
$d$-tuple $T=(T_1, \ldots, T_d)$ of commuting bounded linear operators by the rule: 

\begin{equation}
k\cdot T:=\big(k_1(T_1, \ldots, T_d), \ldots, k_d(T_1, \ldots, T_d)\big),\,\, k\in  K,
\end{equation}

where $k_1( z), \ldots, k_d( z)$ are linear polynomials. 

If the orbit of this action modulo unitary equivalence is a singleton, then we say that $T$ is
$K$-homogeneous. We obtain a model for a certain class of $K$-homogeneous $d$-tuple $T$  as the
operators of multiplication by the coordinate functions $z_1,\ldots ,z_d$ on a $K$- invariant
reproducing kernel Hilbert space of holomorphic functions defined on $\Omega$. Using this model
we obtain a criterion for boundedness,  unitary equivalence and similarity of these $d$-tuples. 

This is joint work with Soumitra Ghara and Paramita Pramanick.

#### Lecture 5​​ ​

__Speaker:__ Ramiz Reza (IISER Pune)

__Title:__ ​ Analytic $m$-isometries and weighted Dirichlet-type spaces

__Abstract:__ ​ We introduce a weighted Dirichlet-type space associated to any $(m − 1)$-tuple of
finite, positive, Borel measures on the unit circle. We show that every cyclic, analytic
$m$-isometry which satisfies a certain set of operator inequalities can be represented as an
operator of multiplication by the coordinate function on such a weighted Dirichlet-type space.
This extends a result of Richter on the class of cyclic analytic 2-isometries. Further we explore
various properties of functions in these weighted Dirichlet type spaces.

#### Lecture 6​

__Speaker:__ Jaydeb Sarkar (ISI Bangalore)

__Title:__ ​ Analytic perturbations of unilateral shift

__Abstract:__ The main aim of perturbation theory is to study (and also compare the properties of)
$S:= F + T$, where $F$ is a finite rank (or compact, Hilbert-–Schmidt, Schatten--von Neumann class,
etc.) operator and $T$ is a tractable operator (like unitary, normal, isometry, self-adjoint, etc.)
on some Hilbert space. I will discuss joint work with Susmita Das in which we investigate some basic
properties of shifts ($S$) that are finite rank ($F$) perturbations of the unilateral shift ($T$) on the
classical Hardy space. Here shift ($S$) refers to the multiplication operator by the coordinate function
$z$ on some analytic reproducing kernel Hilbert space defined on the open unit disc in the complex plane.
Also, we will recall and introduce all the background material needed for this talk.
