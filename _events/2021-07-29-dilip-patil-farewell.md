### Abstracts for July 29

#### Lecture 1 ​

__Speaker:__ J&uuml;rgen Herzog (Universit&auml;t Duisburg--Essen, Germany)

__Title:__ ​ A short survey on numerical semigroups

__Abstract:__ 
In this lecture I will give a short survey on numerical semigroups from a
viewpoint of commutative algebra. A numerical semigroup is a subsemigroup
$S$ of the additive semigroup of non-negative integers. One may assume
that the greatest common divisor of the elements of $s$ is one. Then
there is an integer $F(S) \not\in S$, such that all integers bigger than
$F(S)$ belong to $S$. This number is called the Frobenius number of $S$.
For a fixed field $K$ one considers the $K$-algebra $K[S]$ which is the
subalgebra of the polynomial ring $K[t]$  which is generated over $K$ by
the powers $t^s$ with $s\in S$. This algebra is finitely generated and
its relation ideal $I(S)$ is a binomial ideal. In  general it is hard to
compute $I(S)$. I will recall what is known about this ideal by my own
work but also by the work of Bresinsky, Delorme, Gimenez, Sengupta and
Srinivasan, Patil and others. The semigroup ring $K[S]$ is a
Cohen--Macaulay  domain, and by the theorem of Kunz it is Gorenstein if
and only if the semigroup $S$ is symmetric. Barucci, Dobbs and Fontana
introduced pseudo-symmetric numerical semigroups. This concept was
generalized by Barucci and Fr&ouml;berg, who introduced almost symmetric
numerical semigroups. The corresponding semigroup ring is called almost
Gorenstein. One can define almost Gorenstein rings not only in dimension
$1$. A full-fledged theory in this direction has been developed by Goto,
Takahashi and Taniguchi. By considering the trace of the canonical ideal
of a numerical semigroup ring one is led to define nearly Gorenstein
numerical semigroups, as has been done by Hibi, Stamate and myself. I
will briefly discuss these generalizations of Gorensteiness and address a
few open problems related to this.

#### Lecture 2​

__Speaker:__ Jugal K. Verma (IIT Bombay, India)

__Title:__ ​ The Chern number of an $I$-good filtration of ideals

__Abstract:__ 
Let $I$ be an $\mathfrak m$-primary ideal of a Noetherian local ring $R$.
Let $\mathcal F$ be an $I$-good filtration of ideals. The second Hilbert
coefficient $e_1(\mathcal F)$ of the Hilbert polynomial of $\mathcal F$
is called its Chern number. We discuss how the vanishing of the Chern
number characterizes Cohen--Macaulay local rings, regular local rings and
$F$-rational local rings using the $I$-adic filtration, the filtrations
of the integral closure of powers, and the filtration of the tight
closure of powers of a parameter ideal. We provide a partial answer to a
question of C. Huneke about $F$-rational local rings. 

(This is joint work with Saipriya Dubey (IIT Bombay) and Pham Hung
Quy (FPT University, Vietnam).)

#### Lecture 3​

__Speaker:__ Indranath Sengupta (IIT Gandhinagar, India)

__Title:__ ​ Some results on numerical semigroup rings

__Abstract:__ 
We will discuss Professor Patil's contribution in the field of numerical
semigroups and my association with the subject through some old and
recent results.


---

#### Lecture 4​

__Speaker:__ Rajendra V. Gurjar (IIT Bombay, India)

__Title:__ ​ $\mathbb{A}^1$-fibrations on affine varieties

__Abstract:__ 
We will begin with the fundamental result of Fujita--Miyanishi--Sugie that
a smooth affine surface $V$ has log Kodaira dimension $-\infty$ if and
only if $V$ has an $\mathbb{A}^1$-fibration over a smooth curve.
Generalizations of this to singular affine surfaces and higher
dimensional affine varieties raise non-trivial questions. We will
describe some results in these directions. Connection with
locally-nilpotent derivations will be mentioned. Use of topological
arguments for proving some of these results will be indicated.

#### Lecture 5​

__Speaker:__ Martin Kreuzer (Universit&auml;t Passau, Germany)

__Title:__ ​ Differential methods for $0$-dimensional schemes

__Abstract:__ 
Given a $0$-dimensional subscheme $X$ in $\mathbb{P}^n$, the traditional
way to study the geometry of $X$ is to look at algebraic properties of
its homogeneous coordinate ring $R = K[x_0, \ldots, x_n]/I_X$ and the
structure of the canonical module of $R$.

Here we introduce and exploit a novel approach: we look at the K&auml;hler
differential algebra $\Omega_{R/K}$ which is the exterior algebra over
the K&auml;hler differential module $\Omega^1\_{R/K}$ of $X$. Based on a
careful examination of the embedding of R into its normal closure and the
corresponding embedding of $\Omega^1\_{R/K}$, we provide new bounds for
the regularity index of the K&auml;hler differential module and connect it
to the geometry of $X$ in low embedding dimensions.

#### Lecture 6​

__Speaker:__ Leslie Roberts (Queen's University, Canada)

__Title:__ ​ Ideal generators of projective monomial curves in $\mathbb{P}^3$

__Abstract:__ 
I discuss ideal generators of projective monomial curves of degree $d$ in
$\mathbb{P}^3$, based on the paper P. Li, D.P. Patil and L. Roberts,
_Bases and ideal generators for projective monomial curves_,
Communications in Algebra, 40(1), pages 173--191, 2012, which was my last
paper with Dilip. I also discuss more recent observations by Ping Li and
myself.

### Abstracts for July 30

#### Lecture 1 ​

__Speaker:__ Shreedevi Masuti (IIT Dharwad, India)

__Title:__ ​ The Waring rank of binary binomial forms

__Abstract:__ 
It is well known that every form $F$ of degree $d$ over a field can be
expressed as a linear combination of $d$th powers of linear forms. The
least number of summands required for such an expression of $F$ is known
as the Waring rank of $F$. Computing the Waring rank of a form is a
classical problem in mathematics. In this talk we will discuss the Waring
rank of binary binomial forms. This is my joint work with L. Brustenga.

#### Lecture 2​

__Speaker:__ Parnashree Ghosh (ISI Kolkata, India)

__Title:__ ​ Homogeneous locally nilpotent derivations of rank $2$ and $3$ on $k[X,Y,Z]$

__Abstract:__ 
In this talk we will discuss homogeneous locally nilpotent derivations
(LND) on $k[X, Y, Z]$ where $k$ is a field of characteristic $0$. For a
homogeneous locally nilpotent derivation $D$ on the polynomial ring in
three variables we will see how the $\deg_D$ values of the linear terms
are related and see a consequence on the rank $3$ homogeneous derivations
of degree $\leq 3$.

Further we will discuss homogeneous locally nilpotent derivations of rank
$2$ and give a characterization of the triangularizable derivations among
those. We will also see the freeness property of a homogeneous
triangularizable LND on $k[X, Y, Z]$.

#### Lecture 3​

__Speaker:__ Kriti Goel (IIT Gandhinagar, India)

__Title:__ ​ On Row-Factorization matrices and generic ideals

__Abstract:__ 
The concept of Row-factorization (RF) matrices was introduced by A.
Moscariello to explore the properties of numerical semigroups. For
numerical semigroups $H$ minimally generated by an almost arithmetic
sequence, we give a complete description of the RF-matrices associated
with their pseudo-Frobenius elements. We use the information from
RF-matrices to give a characterization of the generic nature of the
defining ideal of the semigroup. Further, when $H$ is symmetric and has
embedding dimension 4 or 5, we prove that the defining ideal is minimally
generated by RF-relations.

This is joint work with Om Prakash Bhardwaj and Indranath Sengupta.

#### Lecture 4​

__Speaker:__ Neena Gupta (ISI Kolkata, India)

__Title:__ ​ On $2$-stably isomorphic four dimensional affine domains

__Abstract:__ 
A famous theorem of Abhyankar--Eakin--Heinzer proves that if $A$ is a one
dimensional ring containing $\mathbb{Q}$ and $n \ge 1$ be such that the
polynomial ring in $n$-variables over $A$ is isomorphic to the polynomial
ring in $n$ variables over $B$ for some ring $B$, then $A \cong B$. This
does not hold in higher dimensional rings in general. In this connection
the following question arises:

_If $A[X,Y] \cong B[X,Y]$, does this imply $A \cong B$?_

In this talk we shall present four dimensional seminormal affine domains
over ${\mathbb C}$ for which the above question does not hold. 

This is a joint work with Professor T. Asanuma.
