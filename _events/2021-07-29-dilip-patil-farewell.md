### Abstracts for July 29

#### Lecture 1 ​

__Speaker:__ J&uuml;rgen Herzog (Universit&auml;t Duisburg--Essen, Germany)

__Title:__ ​ A short survey on numerical semigroups

__Abstract:__ 
In this lecture I will give a short survey on numerical semigroups from a
viewpoint of commutative algebra. A numerical semigroup is a subsemigroup
$S$ of the additive semigroup of non-negative integers. One may assume
that the greatest common divisor of the elements of $s$ is one. Then
there is an integer $F(S) \not\in S$, such that all integers bigger than
$F(S)$ belong to $S$. This number is called the Frobenius number of $S$.
For a fixed field $K$ one considers the $K$-algebra $K[S]$ which is the
subalgebra of the polynomial ring $K[t]$  which is generated over $K$ by
the powers $t^s$ with $s\in S$. This algebra is finitely generated and
its relation ideal $I(S)$ is a binomial ideal. In  general it is hard to
compute $I(S)$. I will recall what is known about this ideal by my own
work but also by the work of Bresinsky, Delorme, Gimenez, Sengupta and
Srinivasan, Patil and others. The semigroup ring $K[S]$ is a
Cohen--Macaulay  domain, and by the theorem of Kunz it is Gorenstein if
and only if the semigroup $S$ is symmetric. Barucci, Dobbs and Fontana
introduced pseudo-symmetric numerical semigroups. This concept was
generalized by Barucci and Fr&ounl;berg, who introduced almost symmetric
numerical semigroups. The corresponding semigroup ring is called almost
Gorenstein. One can define almost Gorenstein rings not only in dimension
$1$. A full-fledged theory in this direction has been developed by Goto,
Takahashi and Taniguchi. By considering the trace of the canonical ideal
of a numerical semigroup ring one is led to define nearly Gorenstein
numerical semigroups, as has been done by Hibi, Stamate and myself. I
will briefly discuss these generalizations of Gorensteiness and address a
few open problems related to this.

#### Lecture 2​

__Speaker:__ Jugal K. Verma (IIT Bombay, India)

__Title:__ ​ The Chern number of an $I$-good filtration of ideals

__Abstract:__ 
Let $I$ be an $\mathfrak m$-primary ideal of a Noetherian local ring $R$.
Let $\mathcal F$ be an $I$-good filtration of ideals. The second Hilbert
coefficient $e_1(\mathcal F)$ of the Hilbert polynomial of $\mathcal F$
is called its Chern number. We discuss how the vanishing of the Chern
number characterizes Cohen--Macaulay local rings, regular local rings and
$F$-rational local rings using the $I$-adic filtration, the filtrations
of the integral closure of powers, and the filtration of the tight
closure of powers of a parameter ideal. We provide a partial answer to a
question of C.\ Huneke about $F$-rational local rings. 

(This is joint work with Saipriya Dubey (IIT Bombay) and Pham Hung
Quy (FPT University, Vietnam).)
