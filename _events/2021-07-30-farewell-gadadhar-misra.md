### Abstracts

#### Lecture 1 ​

__Speaker:__ Sameer Chavan (IIT Kanpur)

__Title:__ ​ Positivity aspects of Dirichlet series

__Abstract:__ In the first half of this talk, we discuss the space $\mathcal D[s]$
of finite Dirichlet series considered as a subspace of continuous functions on
$\mathbb R_+$. Unlike the space of polynomials, $\mathcal D[s]$ fails to be an
adapted space in the sense of Choquet. This causes an obstruction in identifying
all positive linear functionals on $\mathcal D[s]$ as moment functionals (an analog
of the so-called Riesz--Haviland Theorem). One solution (direct) to this problem
can be based on a well-known one-point compactification technique in moment theory.
Another solution (rather indirect) takes us to the topics like $\log$-moment
sequences and Helson matrices of independent interest. In the second half, we focus
on half-plane analog of the weighted Hardy spaces. The motivating example comes from
the Riemann zeta function. We address the problem of finding members/multipliers of
these spaces.

__Speaker:__ Somnath Hazra (IISER Kolkata)

__Title:__ ​ A family of homogeneous operators in the Cowen--Douglas class over the poly-disc

__Abstract:__ ​  In this talk, we first describe a family of reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces of holomorphic functions taking values in $\mathbb{C}^r$ on the unit poly-disc
$\mathbb{D}^n$ depending upon $r+n$ parameters of positive real numbers for any natural
number $r$. It is then shown that these reproducing kernels are quasi-invariant with
respect to the subgroup M\"ob$\times\cdots\times$M\"ob ($n$ times) of the bi-holomorphic
automorphism group of $\mathbb{D}^n$. Using the quasi-invariant property, these reproducing
kernels can be described explicitly. The adjoint of the $n-$tuples of multiplication operators
by co-ordinate functions on these Hilbert spaces turn out to be homogeneous, irreducible,
mutually unitarily inequivalent and in the Cowen-Douglas class over $\mathbb{D}^n$.

__Title:__ ​ The Caratheodory--Fejer interpolation on the polydisc

__Abstract:__ CF-Problem: Given any polynomial $p$ in $n$-variables of degree $d$, find necessary
and sufficient conditions on the coefficients of $p$ to ensure the existence of a holomorphic
function $h$ defined on the polydisc such that $f:=p+h$ maps the polydisc into the unit disc in the
complex plane and that for any multi-index $I$ with length at most $d$ $h^{(I)}(\boldsymbol 0)=0.$ 
In this talk, we give an algorithm for finding a solution to the Caratheodory--Fejer interpolation
problem on the polydisc, whenever it exists. A necessary condition for the existence of a solution
becomes apparent from this algorithm. Along the way a generalization of the well-known theorem
due to Nehari will be obtained.

__Title:__ ​ Comparing the largest eigenvalues of two random matrices

__Abstract:__ Let $T(m,n)$ denote the largest singular value of the complex Wishart matrix $W_{m,n}$
whose entries are independent random variables with real and imaginary parts that are
independent standard Gaussians. Riddhipratim Basu asked the question whether $T(n,n)$ is larger
than $T(n-1,n+1)$ in a stochastic sense, i.e., $P\\{T(n,n)>x\\} \\ge P\\{T(n-1,n+1)>x\\}$ for all $x$. We provide a
positive answer by invoking a general coupling theorem of Lyons for determinantal point
processes. There are natural extensions of the question for which we do not know the answer.
For example, if the entries of W are real-valued Gaussian random variables.

__Title:__ ​ Interpolation of entire functions

__Abstract:__ ​ For various reasons (applied mathematics as well as algebraic geometry) it is
interesting to ask the following question :
Given a holomorphic function with "finite energy" on a subset of $\\mathbb{C}^n$, can you extend it to all
of $\\mathbb{C}^n$ still having finite energy ?
The answer to this question is known (almost completely) for a sequence of points in $\\mathbb{C}$ with an
$L^2$ notion of the energy. After recalling the results in $\\mathbb{C}$, we shall describe what happens in
higher dimensions with the help of an example or two.

__Title:__ ​ Entrywise functions and 2x2 matrices: from Schur (and his student), to Loewner (and his
student), to Schur

__Abstract:__ Given a smooth function $f : \[0,1) \\to \\mathbb{R}$, and scalars $u_j$, $v_j$ in $(0,1)$, I will compute the
Taylor (Maclaurin) series of the function $F(t) := \\det A(t)$, where $A(t)$ is the $2 \times 2$ matrix

`\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}
f( t u_1 v_1 ) & f( t u_1 v_2 ) \\
f( t u_2 v_1 ) & f( t u_2 v_2 )
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}`

C. Loewner computed the first two of these Maclaurin coefficients, in the thesis of his student
R.A. Horn (*Trans. AMS* 1969). This was in connection with entrywise functions preserving
positivity on matrices of a fixed dimension -- the case of all dimensions following from earlier
work of Schur (*Crelle* 1911) and his student Schoenberg (*Duke* 1942).

It turns out that an "algebraic" family of symmetric functions is hiding inside this "analysis". We
will see how this family emerges when one computes the second-order (and each subsequent
higher-order) Maclaurin coefficient above. This family of functions was introduced by Cauchy
(1800s), studied by Schur in his thesis (1901), and has featured extensively in recent
Eigenfunction Seminars (2017, 2018). As an application, I will generalize a determinant formula
named after Cauchy, which is the special case $f(x) = 1/(1-x)$ and $t=1$ above.
