###  Forwarding your iisc.ac.in mail from microsoft office 365 to another account (say your gmail account for the sake of argument)
 
You just need to go to login.microsoftonline.com/ , login, click the ``mail" tile, click the wheel (settings) icon next to the question mark on the right-hand top corner, type ``forwarding" in the search bar, click the first result, and enter the details of the email account you want to forward to (your gmail account in this example).

### Sending email from your gmail account and make it appear as if you are sending from your iisc.ac.in account

Click the wheel (settings) in the right hand corner of your gmail account (after logging in). Then click on settings. After that, ``accounts and import". In ``send mail as", click on ``add another email address". Now write your email address (in my case vamsipingali@iisc.ac.in). Click next. In the SMTP server information, write outlook-apacnorth.office365.com. Select port 587. In  your username, write your full email address (in my case vamsipingali@iisc.ac.in) and enter the password you use to login to microsoft office 365. Click next and verify.
