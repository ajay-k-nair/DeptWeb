### Creating a webpage hosted on the maths server

0. [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) has a nice set of resources for learning web development (and it caters to all appetites, including novices). Alternatively, one can browse through standard resources such as [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/). One can also simply copy your favourite faculty member's webpage design by right clicking anywhere on that webpage and clicking on view source.

1. ssh into your mathematics account. (See [this page for details.](http://www.math.iisc.ac.in/sshinfo.html)) Create a folder called public_html. 

2. Create your webpage locally, i.e., on your PC and upload all the files (including index.html which will be your main page) to public_html. Your webpage should be active. The address is "http://www.math.iisc.ac.in/~yourusername".

3. If you are using linux, you need to set the appropriate permissions for your webpage to be live.
