  <h5>  <strong>Time: </strong>2:30 - 3:45 and 4:00 - 5:00 pm </h5>

    <p>We shall discuss a theorem of Bernstein published in
1975about the number of common solutions of n complex polynomials in n
variables in terms of the mixed volumes of their Newton polytopes.
This is a far reaching generalisation of the Fundamental Theorem of
Algebra and Bezout’s Theorem about intersections of plane algebraic
curves. If time permits, we shall sketch a proof of Bernstein’s theorem
using Hilbert functions of monomial ideals in polynomial rings.</p>

    <p>I will give a gentle historical (and ongoing) account of matrix positivity
and of operations that preserve it. This is a classical question studied
for much of the past century, including by Schur, Polya-Szego, Schoenberg,
Kahane, Loewner, and Rudin. It continues to be pursued actively, for both
theoretical reasons as well as applications to high-dimensional covariance
estimation. I will end with some recent joint work with Terence Tao
(UCLA).</p>

<p>The entire talk should be accessible given a basic understanding of linear
algebra/matrices and one-variable calculus. That said, I will occasionally
insert technical details for the more advanced audience. For example: this
journey connects many seemingly distant mathematical topics, from Schur
(products and complements), to spheres and Gram matrices, to Toeplitz and
Hankel matrices, to rank one updates and Rayleigh quotients, to
Cauchy-Binet and Jacobi-Trudi identities, back full circle to Schur
(polynomials).</p>

  <h5><strong> Title: </strong> <a href="/seminars/vikram.html">The Pick--Nevanlinna interpolation problem: complex-analytic methods in special domains</a> </h5>
 <h5>  <strong>Speaker: </strong> Vikamjit Singh Chandel </h5>
  <h5>  <strong>Date: </strong>17 July 2017 </h5>
  <h5>  <strong>Time: </strong>3:00 p.m. </h5>
  <h5>  <strong>Venue: </strong> </h5>


    <p>The Pick–Nevanlinna interpolation problem in its fullest generality is as
follows:</p>

<p>Given domains D_1, D_2 in complex Euclidean spaces, and a set {(z_i,w_i):
1\leq i\leq N}\subset D_1\times D_2, where z_i are distinct and N is a
positive integer \geq 2, find necessary and sufficient conditions for the
existence of a holomorphic map F from D_1 into D_2 such that F(z_i) = w_i,
1\leq N.</p>

<p>When such a map F exists, we say that F is an interpolant of the data. Of
course, this problem is intractable at the above level of generality.
However, two special cases of the problem – which we shall study in this
thesis – have been of lasting interest:</p>

<p>INTERPOLATION FROM THE POLYDISC TO THE UNIT DISC: This is the case D_1 =
D^n and D_2 = D, where D denotes the open unit disc in the complex plane
and n is a positive integer. The problem itself originates with Georg
Pick’s well-known theorem (independently discovered by Nevanlinna) for the
case n=1. Much later, Sarason gave another proof of Pick’s result using an
operator-theoretic approach, which is very influential. Using this
approach for n\geq 2, Agler–McCarthy provided a solution to the problem
with the restriction that the interpolant is in the Schur–Agler class.
This is notable because when n = 2 the latter result completely solves the
problem for the case D_1 = D^2, D_2 = D. However, Pick’s approach can also
be effective for n\geq 2. In this thesis, we give an alternative
characterization for the existence of a 3-point interpolant based on
Pick’s approach and involving the study of rational inner functions.</p>

<p>Cole, Lewis and Wermer lifted Sarason’s approach to uniform algebras –
leading to a characterization for the existence of an interpolant in terms
of the positivity of a large, rather abstractly-defined family of (N\times
N) matrices. McCullough later refined their result by identifying a
smaller family of matrices. The second result of this thesis is in the
same vein, namely: it provides a characterization of those data that admit
a D^n-to-D interpolant in terms of the positivity of a family of matrices
parametrized by a class of polynomials.</p>

<p>INTERPOLATION FORM THE UNIT DISC TO THE SPECTRAL UNIT BALL: This is the
case D_1 = D and D_2 is the set of all (n\times n) matrices with spectral
radius less than 1. The interest in this arises from problems in Control
Theory. Bercovici, Fois and Tannenbaum adapted Sarason’s methods to give a
(somewhat hard-to-check) characterization for the existence of an
interpolant under a very mild restriction. Later, Agler–Young established
a relation between the interpolation problem in the spectral unit ball and
that in the symmetrized polydisc – leading to a necessary condition for
the existence of an interpolant. Bharali later provided a new inequivalent
necessary condition for the existence of an interpolant for any n and N=2.
We shall present a necessary condition for the existence of a 3-point
interpolant. This we shall achieve by modifying Pick’s approach and
applying the aforementioned result due to Bharali.</p>

  <h5>  <strong>Date: </strong>08 June 2017 </h5>
  <h5>  <strong>Time: </strong>3 p.m. </h5>
  <h5>  <strong>Venue: </strong> </h5>


    <p>The aim of this talk is to give an overview of some recent
results in two
interconnected areas:</p>

<p><strong>a) Random discrete structures:</strong> One major conjecture in probabilistic
combinatorics, formulated by statistical physicists using non-rigorous
arguments and enormous simulations in the early 2000s, is as follows: for a
wide array of random graph models on [image: n] vertices and degree
exponent [image: \tau&gt;3], typical distance both within maximal components
in the critical regime as well as on the minimal spanning tree on the giant
component in the supercritical regime scale like [image:
n^{\frac{\tau\wedge 4 -3}{\tau\wedge 4 -1}}]. In other words, the degree
exponent determines the universality class the random graph belongs to. The
mathematical machinery available at the time was insufficient for providing
a rigorous justification of this conjecture.</p>

<p>More generally, recent research has provided strong evidence to believe
that several objects, including
(i) components under critical percolation,
(ii) the vacant set left by a random walk, and
(iii) the minimal spanning tree,
constructed on a wide class of random discrete structures converge, when
viewed
as metric measure spaces, to some random fractals in the Gromov-Hausdorff
sense, and these limiting objects are universal under some general
assumptions. We will discuss recent developments in a larger program aimed
at a complete resolution of these conjectures.</p>

<p><strong>b) Stochastic geometry:</strong>  In contrast, less precise results are known in the
case of spatial systems. We discuss a recent result concerning the length
of spatial minimal spanning trees that answers a question raised by Kesten
and Lee in the 90’s, the proof of which relies on a variation of Stein’s
method and a quantification of a classical argument in percolation theory.</p>

<p>Based on joint work with Louigi Addario-Berry, Shankar Bhamidi, Nicolas
Broutin, Sourav Chatterjee, Remco van der Hofstad, and Xuan Wang.</p>

 <h5>  <strong>Speaker: </strong> Rishi Vyas (Ben Gurion University, Israel) </h5>
  <h5>  <strong>Date: </strong>06 June 2017 </h5>
  <h5>  <strong>Time: </strong>3 p.m. </h5>
  <h5>  <strong>Venue: </strong> </h5>


    <p>The notion of a weakly proregular sequence in a commutative ring was first
formally introduced by Alonso-Jeremias-Lipman (though the property that it
formalizes was already known to Grothendieck), and further studied by
Schenzel and Porta-Shaul-Yekutieli: a precise definition of this notion
will be given during the talk. An ideal in a commutative ring is called
weakly proregular if it has a weakly proregular generating set.  Every
ideal in a commutative noetherian ring is weakly proregular.
It turns out that weak proregularity is the appropriate context for the
Matlis-Greenlees-May (MGM) equivalence: given a weakly proregular ideal I
in a commutative ring A, there is an equivalence of triangulated
categories (given in one direction by derived local cohomology and in the
other by derived completion at I) between cohomologically I-torsion (i.e.
complexes with I-torsion cohomology) and cohomologically I-complete
complexes in the derived category of A.</p>

<p>In this talk, we will give a categorical characterization of weak
proregularity: this characterization then serves as the foundation for a
noncommutative generalisation of this notion. As a consequence, we will
arrive at a noncommutative variant of the MGM equivalence. This work is
joint with Amnon Yekutieli.</p>

  <h5><strong> Title: </strong> <a href="/seminars/rishi-vyas.html">Dualizing Complexes in the Noncommutative Arithmetic Contex</a> </h5>
 <h5>  <strong>Speaker: </strong> Rishi Vyas (Ben Gurion University, Israel) </h5>
  <h5>  <strong>Date: </strong>06 June 2017 </h5>
  <h5>  <strong>Time: </strong>3pm </h5>
  <h5>  <strong>Venue: </strong> </h5>


    <p>Dualizing complexes were first introduced in commutative
algebra and algebraic geometry by Grothendieck and play a fundamental role
in Serre-Grothendieck duality theory for schemes. The notion of a
dualizing complex was extended to noncommutative ring theory by Yekutieli.
There are existence theorems for dualizing complexes in the noncommutative
context, due to Van den Bergh, Wu, Zhang, and Yekutieli amongst others.</p>

<p>Most considerations of dualizing complexes over noncommutative rings are
for algebras defined over fields. There are technical difficulties
involved in extending this theory to algebras defined over more general
commutative base rings. In this talk, we will describe these challenges
and how to get around them. Time permitting, we will end by presenting an
existence theorem for dualizing complexes in this more general setting.</p>

<p>The material described in this talk is work in progress, carried out
jointly with Amnon Yekutieli.</p>

  <h5>  <strong>Time: </strong>3 p.m. </h5>
  <h5>  <strong>Venue: </strong> </h5>


    <p>Abstract: The field of geodynamics deals with the large scale forces
shaping the Earth. Computational geodynamics, which uses numerical
modeling, is one of the most important tools to understand the mechanisms
within the deep Earth. With the help of these numerical models we can
address some of the outstanding questions regarding the processes
operating within the Earth’s interior and their control on shaping the
surface of the planet. Much of Earth’s surface observations such as
gravity anomalies, plate motions, dynamic topography, lithosphere stress
field, owe their origin to convection within the Earth’s mantle. While we
understand the basic nature of such flow in the mantle, a lot remains
unexplained, including the complex rheology of the deep mantle and how
this density driven convective flow couples with the shallow surface. In
this talk I will discuss how my group is using numerical modeling to
understand the influence of the deep mantle on surface observations.</p>

    <p>For a finite abelian group G with |G| = n, the Davenport
Constant DA(G) is defined to be the least integer k such that any sequence
S with length k of elements in G has a non-empty A weighted zero-sum
subsequence. For certain sets A, we already know the precise value of
constant corresponding to the cyclic group Zn. But for different group G
and A, the precise value of it is still an open question. We try to find
out bounds for these combinatorial invariant for random set A. We got few
results in this connection. In this talk I would like to present those
results and discuss about an extremal problem related to this
combinatorial invariant.</p>

  <h5><strong> Title: </strong> <a href="/seminars/roncal.html">Weighted norm inequalities for rough singular integral operators</a> </h5>
 <h5>  <strong>Speaker: </strong> Luz Roncal (BCAM -  Basque Center for Applied Mathematics) </h5>
  <h5>  <strong>Date: </strong>24 April 2017 </h5>
  <h5>  <strong>Time: </strong>4pm </h5>
  <h5>  <strong>Venue: </strong>LH-1 </h5>


    <p>Abstract : The study of weighted inequalities in Classical Harmonic
Analysis started in 70’s, when B. Muckenhoupt characterised in 1972 the
weights $w$ for which the Hardy–Littlewood maximal function is bounded in
$L^p(w)$. At that time the question about how the operator depended on the
constant associated with $w$, which we denote by $[w]_{A_p}$, was not
considered (i.e., \textit{quantitative estimates}) were not investigated.</p>

<p>From the beginning of 2000’s, a great activity has been carried out in
order to obtain the sharp dependence for singular integral operators,
reaching the solution of the so-called $A_2$ conjecture by T. P.
H"ytonen.</p>

<p>In this talk we consider operators with homogeneous singular kernels, on
which we assume smoothness conditions that are weaker than the standard
ones (this is why they are called rough). The first qualitative weighted
estimates are due to J. Duoandikoetxea and J. L. Rubio de Francia. For the
norm of these operators in the space $L^2(w)$ we obtain a quantitative
estimate which is quadratic in the constant $[w]_{A_2}$.</p>

<p>The results are based on a classical decomposition of the rough operators
as a sum of other operators with a smoother kernel, for which a
quantitative reelaboration of a dyadic decomposition proposed by M. T.
Lacey is applied.</p>

<p>We will overview as well the most recent advances, mainly associated with
quantitative estimates for these rough singular integrals. In particular,
Coifman–Fefferman type inequalities (which are new even in their
qualitative version), weighted $A_p-A_{\infty}$ inequalities and a
quantitative version of weak $(1,1)$ estimates will be shown.</p>

    <p>Abstract: Conformal blocks are refined invariants of tensor product of
representations of a Lie algebra that give a special class of vector
bundles on the moduli space of curves. In this talk, I will introduce
conformal blocks and explore connections to questions in algebraic
geometry
and representation theory. I will also focus on some ``strange” dualities
in representation theory and how they give equalities of divisor classes
on
the moduli space of curves.</p>

    <p>Abstract: The Riemann-Roch theorem is fundamental to algebraic geometry.
In 2006, Baker and Norine discovered an analogue of the Riemann-Roch
theorem for graphs. In fact, this theorem is not a mere analogue but has
concrete relations with its algebro-geometric counterpart. Since its
conception this topic has been explored in different directions, two
significant directions are i. Connections to topics in discrete geometry
and commutative algebra ii. As a tool to studying linear series on
algebraic curves. We will provide a glimpse of these developments. Topics
in commutative algebra such as Alexander duality and minimal free
resolutions will make an appearance.  This talk is based on my
dissertation and joint work with i. Bernd Sturmfels, ii. Frank-Olaf
Schreyer and John Wilmes and iii. an ongoing work with Alex Fink.</p>

    <p>Abstract : The Hadamard product of two matrices is formed by multiplying
corresponding entries, and the Schur product theorem states that
this operation preserves positive semidefiniteness.</p>

<p>It follows immediately that every analytic function with non-negative
Maclaurin coefficients, when applied entrywise, preserves positive
semidefiniteness for matrices of any order. The converse is due to
Schoenberg: a function which preserves positive semidefiniteness for
matrices of arbitrary order is necessarily analytic and has non-negative
Maclaurin coefficients.</p>

<p>For matrices of fixed order, the situation is more interesting. This talk
will present recent work which shows the existence of polynomials with
negative leading term which preserve positive semidefiniteness, and
characterises precisely how large this term may be.</p>

    <p>Abstract: Commutators of singular integral operators with BMO functions
were introduced in the seventies by Coifman-Rochberg and Weiss. These
operators are very interesting for many reasons, one of them being the
fact that they are more singular than Calder ́on-Zygmundm operators.
In this lecture we plan to give several reasons showing the ”bad” behavior
of these operators.</p>

    <p>Abstract: The goal of this talk is to present an algorithm which takes a
compact square complex belonging to a special class as input and decides
whether its fundamental group splits as a free product. The special class
is built by attaching tubes to finite graphs in such a way that they
satisfy a nonpositive curvature condition. This construction gives rise to
a rich class of complexes, including, but not limited to, closed surfaces
of positive genus.
The algorithm can be used to deduce the celebrated Stallings theorem for
this special class, as also the well known Grushko decomposition theorem.</p>

    <p>Abstract:</p>

<p>A group is cyclic iff its subgroup lattice is distributive. Ore’s
generalized one direction of this result. We will discuss a dual version
of Ore’s result, for any boolean interval of finite groups under the
assumption that the dual Euler totient of the interval is nonzero. We
conjecture that the dual Euler totient is always nonzero for boolean
intervals. We will discuss some techniques which may be helpful in proving
it. We first see that dual Euler totient of an interval of finite groups
is the Mobius invariant (upto a sign) of its coset poset P. Next in the
boolean group complemented case, we prove that P is Cohen-Macaulay, using
the existence of an explicit EL-labeling. We then see that nontrivial
betti number of the order complex is nonzero, and so is the dual Euler
totient.</p>

  <h5>  <strong>Time: </strong>4pm </h5>

    <p>Abstract: Quasi-algebras were introduced as algebras in a monoidal
category. Since the associativity constraints in these categories are
allowed to be nontrivial, the class of quasi-algebras contains various
important examples of non-associative algebras like the octonions and
other Cayley algebras.
The diamond lemma is a reduction method used in algebra. The original
diamond lemma was stated in graph theory by Newman which was later
generalized to associative algebras by Bergman. In this talk, we will see
the analog of this lemma for the group graded quasi-algebras with some
interesting examples like octonion algebra and generalized octonions</p>

    <p>Abstract:</p>

<p>In this talk, I would continue dealing with Sabra shell model of
Turbulence and study one of the important questions for fluid flow
problems namely, finding controls which are capable of preserving the
invariant quantities of the flow.   Controls are designed in the feedback
form such that resultant controlled flow will preserve certain physical
properties of the state such as enstrophy, helicity. We use the theory of
nonlinear semigroups and represent the feedback control as a multi-valued
feedback term which lies in the normal cone of the convex constraint space
under consideration.</p>

    <p>Abstract:</p>

<p>In this lecture I am going to present control problems associated with
shell models of Turbulence. Shell models of turbulence are simplified
caricatures of equations of fluid mechanics in wave-vector representation.
 They exhibit anomalous scaling and local non-linear interactions in wave
number space. We would like to study control problem related to one such
widely accepted shell model of turbulence known as sabra shell model. We
associate two cost functionals: one ensures minimizing  turbulence in the
system and the other addresses the need of taking the ow near a priori
known state. We derive the optimal controls in terms of the solution of
adjoint equation for corresponding linearised problems.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> 
In algebraic geometry the concept of height pairing (a
particular example
of linking numbers) of algebraic cycles lies at the confluence of arithmetic,
Hodge theory and topology. In a series of two talks, I will explain the
notion
of Beilinson’s height pairing for cycles homologous to zero. This will bring
into picture the notion of Arakelov/arithmetic intersection theory. I will
give
sufficient background of this theory and provide examples. Finally, I will
talk
about my recent work with Dr. Jose Ignacio Burgos, about a generalization
of Beilinson’s height pairing for higher algebraic cycles.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
A porous medium (concrete, soil, rocks, water reservoir, e.g.)
is a multiscale medium
where the heterogeneities present in the medium are characterized by the
micro scale and the
global behaviors of the medium are observed at the macro scale. The
upscaling from the micro
scale to the macro scale can be done via averaging methods.</p>

<p>In this talk, diffusion and reaction of several mobile chemical species
are considered in
the pore space of a heterogeneous porous medium. The reactions amongst the
species are
modelled via mass action kinetics and the modelling leads to a system of
multispecies diffusion;
reaction equations (coupled semi-linear partial differential
equations) at the micro scale where
the highly nonlinear reaction rate terms are present at the right hand
sides of the system of PDEs,
cf. [2]. The existence of a unique positive global weak solution is shown
with the help of a
Lyapunov functional, Schaefer’s fixed point theorem and maximal
Lp-regularity, cf. [2, 3]. Finally,
with the help of periodic homogenization and two-scale convergence
we upscale the model from
the micro scale to the macro scale, e.g. [1, 3]. Some numerical
simulations will also be shown in
this talk, however for the purpose of illustration, we restrict ourselves
to some relatively simple
2- dimensional situations.</p>

<p>As an extension to the previous model, we consider the mixture of two
fluids. For such
models, a system of Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard equations will be
considered at the micro scale in a
perforated porous medium. We first explain the periodic setting of the
model and the existence
results. At the end homogenization of the model will be shown using some
extension theorems
on Sobolev spaces, two-scale convergence and periodic unfolding.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
As big data sets have become more common, there has been significant
interest in finding and understanding patterns in them. One example of a
simple pattern is the distance between data points, which can be thought of
as a 2-point configuration. Two classic questions, the Erdos distinct
distance problem, which asks about the least number of distinct distances
determined by N points in the plane, and its continuous analog, the
Falconer distance problem, explore that simple pattern. Questions similar
to the Erdos distinct distance problem and the Falconer distance problem
can also be posed for more complicated patterns such as triangles, which
can be viewed as 3-point configurations. In this talk I will present recent
Falconer type theorems, established by myself and my collaborators, for a
wide class of finite point configurations in any dimension. The techniques
we used come from analysis and geometric measure theory, and the key step
was to obtain bounds on multilinear analogues of generalized Radon
transforms.</p>

We consider a fourth order traveling wave equation associated to
the Suspension Bridge Problem (SBP). This equations are modeled by the
traveling wave behavior on the Narrows Tacoma and the Golden Gate bridge.
We prove existence of homoclinic solutions when the wave speed is small.
We will also discuss the associated  fourth order Liouville theorem to the
problem and possible link with the De Giorgi’s conjecture.  This is an
attempt to prove the McKenna-Walter conjecture which is open for the last
two decades.</p>
