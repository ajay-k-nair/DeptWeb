  <h5>  <strong>Time: </strong>2:30 - 3:45 and 4:00 - 5:00 pm </h5>
  <h5>  <strong>Venue: </strong> </h5>


    <p>We shall discuss a theorem of Bernstein published in
1975about the number of common solutions of n complex polynomials in n
variables in terms of the mixed volumes of their Newton polytopes.
This is a far reaching generalisation of the Fundamental Theorem of
Algebra and Bezout’s Theorem about intersections of plane algebraic
curves. If time permits, we shall sketch a proof of Bernstein’s theorem
using Hilbert functions of monomial ideals in polynomial rings.</p>

  <h5><strong> Title: </strong> <a href="/seminars/roncal.html">Weighted norm inequalities for rough singular integral operators</a> </h5>
 <h5>  <strong>Speaker: </strong> Luz Roncal (BCAM -  Basque Center for Applied Mathematics) </h5>
  <h5>  <strong>Date: </strong>24 April 2017 </h5>
  <h5>  <strong>Time: </strong>4pm </h5>
  <h5>  <strong>Venue: </strong>LH-1 </h5>


    <p>Abstract : The study of weighted inequalities in Classical Harmonic
Analysis started in 70’s, when B. Muckenhoupt characterised in 1972 the
weights $w$ for which the Hardy–Littlewood maximal function is bounded in
$L^p(w)$. At that time the question about how the operator depended on the
constant associated with $w$, which we denote by $[w]_{A_p}$, was not
considered (i.e., \textit{quantitative estimates}) were not investigated.</p>

<p>From the beginning of 2000’s, a great activity has been carried out in
order to obtain the sharp dependence for singular integral operators,
reaching the solution of the so-called $A_2$ conjecture by T. P.
H"ytonen.</p>

<p>In this talk we consider operators with homogeneous singular kernels, on
which we assume smoothness conditions that are weaker than the standard
ones (this is why they are called rough). The first qualitative weighted
estimates are due to J. Duoandikoetxea and J. L. Rubio de Francia. For the
norm of these operators in the space $L^2(w)$ we obtain a quantitative
estimate which is quadratic in the constant $[w]_{A_2}$.</p>

<p>The results are based on a classical decomposition of the rough operators
as a sum of other operators with a smoother kernel, for which a
quantitative reelaboration of a dyadic decomposition proposed by M. T.
Lacey is applied.</p>

<p>We will overview as well the most recent advances, mainly associated with
quantitative estimates for these rough singular integrals. In particular,
Coifman–Fefferman type inequalities (which are new even in their
qualitative version), weighted $A_p-A_{\infty}$ inequalities and a
quantitative version of weak $(1,1)$ estimates will be shown.</p>

  <h5>  <strong>Time: </strong>10 AM (via Skype) </h5>
  <h5>  <strong>Venue: </strong>LH-1 </h5>


    <p>Abstract: Conformal blocks are refined invariants of tensor product of
representations of a Lie algebra that give a special class of vector
bundles on the moduli space of curves. In this talk, I will introduce
conformal blocks and explore connections to questions in algebraic
geometry
and representation theory. I will also focus on some ``strange” dualities
in representation theory and how they give equalities of divisor classes
on
the moduli space of curves.</p>

  <h5>  <strong>Date: </strong>20 April 2017 </h5>
  <h5>  <strong>Time: </strong>4pm </h5>

    <p>Abstract: The Riemann-Roch theorem is fundamental to algebraic geometry.
In 2006, Baker and Norine discovered an analogue of the Riemann-Roch
theorem for graphs. In fact, this theorem is not a mere analogue but has
concrete relations with its algebro-geometric counterpart. Since its
conception this topic has been explored in different directions, two
significant directions are i. Connections to topics in discrete geometry
and commutative algebra ii. As a tool to studying linear series on
algebraic curves. We will provide a glimpse of these developments. Topics
in commutative algebra such as Alexander duality and minimal free
resolutions will make an appearance.  This talk is based on my
dissertation and joint work with i. Bernd Sturmfels, ii. Frank-Olaf
Schreyer and John Wilmes and iii. an ongoing work with Alex Fink.</p>

  <h5>  <strong>Date: </strong>05 April 2017 </h5>
  <h5>  <strong>Time: </strong>4pm </h5>
  <h5>  <strong>Venue: </strong>LH-1 </h5>


    <p>Abstract : The Hadamard product of two matrices is formed by multiplying
corresponding entries, and the Schur product theorem states that
this operation preserves positive semidefiniteness.</p>

<p>It follows immediately that every analytic function with non-negative
Maclaurin coefficients, when applied entrywise, preserves positive
semidefiniteness for matrices of any order. The converse is due to
Schoenberg: a function which preserves positive semidefiniteness for
matrices of arbitrary order is necessarily analytic and has non-negative
Maclaurin coefficients.</p>

<p>For matrices of fixed order, the situation is more interesting. This talk
will present recent work which shows the existence of polynomials with
negative leading term which preserve positive semidefiniteness, and
characterises precisely how large this term may be.</p>

  <h5>  <strong>Date: </strong>28 March 2017 </h5>
  <h5>  <strong>Time: </strong>4pm </h5>
  <h5>  <strong>Venue: </strong>LH-1 </h5>


    <p>Abstract: Commutators of singular integral operators with BMO functions
were introduced in the seventies by Coifman-Rochberg and Weiss. These
operators are very interesting for many reasons, one of them being the
fact that they are more singular than Calder ́on-Zygmundm operators.
In this lecture we plan to give several reasons showing the ”bad” behavior
of these operators.</p>

  <h5>  <strong>Time: </strong>9:30 a.m. </h5>
  <h5>  <strong>Venue: </strong>LH-1, Department of Mathematics </h5>


    <p>Abstract: The goal of this talk is to present an algorithm which takes a
compact square complex belonging to a special class as input and decides
whether its fundamental group splits as a free product. The special class
is built by attaching tubes to finite graphs in such a way that they
satisfy a nonpositive curvature condition. This construction gives rise to
a rich class of complexes, including, but not limited to, closed surfaces
of positive genus.
The algorithm can be used to deduce the celebrated Stallings theorem for
this special class, as also the well known Grushko decomposition theorem.</p>

    <p>Abstract:</p>

<p>A group is cyclic iff its subgroup lattice is distributive. Ore’s
generalized one direction of this result. We will discuss a dual version
of Ore’s result, for any boolean interval of finite groups under the
assumption that the dual Euler totient of the interval is nonzero. We
conjecture that the dual Euler totient is always nonzero for boolean
intervals. We will discuss some techniques which may be helpful in proving
it. We first see that dual Euler totient of an interval of finite groups
is the Mobius invariant (upto a sign) of its coset poset P. Next in the
boolean group complemented case, we prove that P is Cohen-Macaulay, using
the existence of an explicit EL-labeling. We then see that nontrivial
betti number of the order complex is nonzero, and so is the dual Euler
totient.</p>

  <h5>  <strong>Date: </strong>02 March 2017 </h5>
  <h5>  <strong>Time: </strong>4pm </h5>
  <h5>  <strong>Venue: </strong>LH-1 </h5>


    <p>Abstract: Quasi-algebras were introduced as algebras in a monoidal
category. Since the associativity constraints in these categories are
allowed to be nontrivial, the class of quasi-algebras contains various
important examples of non-associative algebras like the octonions and
other Cayley algebras.
The diamond lemma is a reduction method used in algebra. The original
diamond lemma was stated in graph theory by Newman which was later
generalized to associative algebras by Bergman. In this talk, we will see
the analog of this lemma for the group graded quasi-algebras with some
interesting examples like octonion algebra and generalized octonions</p>

    <p>Abstract:</p>

<p>In this talk, I would continue dealing with Sabra shell model of
Turbulence and study one of the important questions for fluid flow
problems namely, finding controls which are capable of preserving the
invariant quantities of the flow.   Controls are designed in the feedback
form such that resultant controlled flow will preserve certain physical
properties of the state such as enstrophy, helicity. We use the theory of
nonlinear semigroups and represent the feedback control as a multi-valued
feedback term which lies in the normal cone of the convex constraint space
under consideration.</p>

    <p>Abstract:</p>

<p>In this lecture I am going to present control problems associated with
shell models of Turbulence. Shell models of turbulence are simplified
caricatures of equations of fluid mechanics in wave-vector representation.
 They exhibit anomalous scaling and local non-linear interactions in wave
number space. We would like to study control problem related to one such
widely accepted shell model of turbulence known as sabra shell model. We
associate two cost functionals: one ensures minimizing  turbulence in the
system and the other addresses the need of taking the ow near a priori
known state. We derive the optimal controls in terms of the solution of
adjoint equation for corresponding linearised problems.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> 
In algebraic geometry the concept of height pairing (a
particular example
of linking numbers) of algebraic cycles lies at the confluence of arithmetic,
Hodge theory and topology. In a series of two talks, I will explain the
notion
of Beilinson’s height pairing for cycles homologous to zero. This will bring
into picture the notion of Arakelov/arithmetic intersection theory. I will
give
sufficient background of this theory and provide examples. Finally, I will
talk
about my recent work with Dr. Jose Ignacio Burgos, about a generalization
of Beilinson’s height pairing for higher algebraic cycles.</p>

</a> </h5>
 <h5>  <strong>Speaker: </strong> Harishankar Mahato </h5>
  <h5>  <strong>Date: </strong>10 January 2017 </h5>

  <h5>  <strong>Venue: </strong> </h5>


    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
A porous medium (concrete, soil, rocks, water reservoir, e.g.)
is a multiscale medium
where the heterogeneities present in the medium are characterized by the
micro scale and the
global behaviors of the medium are observed at the macro scale. The
upscaling from the micro
scale to the macro scale can be done via averaging methods.</p>

<p>In this talk, diffusion and reaction of several mobile chemical species
are considered in
the pore space of a heterogeneous porous medium. The reactions amongst the
species are
modelled via mass action kinetics and the modelling leads to a system of
multispecies diffusion;
reaction equations (coupled semi-linear partial differential
equations) at the micro scale where
the highly nonlinear reaction rate terms are present at the right hand
sides of the system of PDEs,
cf. [2]. The existence of a unique positive global weak solution is shown
with the help of a
Lyapunov functional, Schaefer’s fixed point theorem and maximal
Lp-regularity, cf. [2, 3]. Finally,
with the help of periodic homogenization and two-scale convergence
we upscale the model from
the micro scale to the macro scale, e.g. [1, 3]. Some numerical
simulations will also be shown in
this talk, however for the purpose of illustration, we restrict ourselves
to some relatively simple
2- dimensional situations.</p>

<p>As an extension to the previous model, we consider the mixture of two
fluids. For such
models, a system of Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard equations will be
considered at the micro scale in a
perforated porous medium. We first explain the periodic setting of the
model and the existence
results. At the end homogenization of the model will be shown using some
extension theorems
on Sobolev spaces, two-scale convergence and periodic unfolding.</p>

As big data sets have become more common, there has been significant
interest in finding and understanding patterns in them. One example of a
simple pattern is the distance between data points, which can be thought of
as a 2-point configuration. Two classic questions, the Erdos distinct
distance problem, which asks about the least number of distinct distances
determined by N points in the plane, and its continuous analog, the
Falconer distance problem, explore that simple pattern. Questions similar
to the Erdos distinct distance problem and the Falconer distance problem
can also be posed for more complicated patterns such as triangles, which
can be viewed as 3-point configurations. In this talk I will present recent
Falconer type theorems, established by myself and my collaborators, for a
wide class of finite point configurations in any dimension. The techniques
we used come from analysis and geometric measure theory, and the key step
was to obtain bounds on multilinear analogues of generalized Radon
transforms.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
Let H denote a connected component of a stratum of translation
surfaces. We show that the Siegel-Veech transform of a bounded compactly
supported function on R2 is in L2(H,μ), where μ is the
Masur-Veech measure on H, and give applications to bounding error terms
for counting problems for saddle connections. We will review classical
results in the Geometry of Numbers which anticipate this result. This is
joint work with Yitwah Cheung and Howard Masur.</p>

    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
We consider a fourth order traveling wave equation associated to
the Suspension Bridge Problem (SBP). This equations are modeled by the
traveling wave behavior on the Narrows Tacoma and the Golden Gate bridge.
We prove existence of homoclinic solutions when the wave speed is small.
We will also discuss the associated  fourth order Liouville theorem to the
problem and possible link with the De Giorgi’s conjecture.  This is an
attempt to prove the McKenna-Walter conjecture which is open for the last
two decades.</p>
